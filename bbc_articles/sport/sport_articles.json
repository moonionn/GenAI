        "content": "This video can not be played\nBiles best bits\nSimone Biles dazzled on her Olympics return as the world's most decorated gymnast showed she was back to her best three years after suffering the 'twisties'.     \nThe American, who has 37 world and Olympic medals, pulled out of several events at the Tokyo Games with the disorientating mental block, and many wondered if she would compete again. But after a two-year break she came back and set her sights on Paris.\nShe had won more world medals since Tokyo, introduced a new skill and looked sharp in training, but no-one really knew what to expect when she entered the Bercy Arena to an eruption of cheers, with A-list celebrities in the stands and a global television audience of millions.\nBut we soon found out.\nAn acrobatic beam routine came before an energetic floor programme that featured one of the five skills named after her. Then she delivered her big Biles II vault but decided not to attempt the new skill she is planning on uneven bars.\nShe scored a total of 59.566 to top the all-around standings with three sub-divisions still to go. It is hard to see that changing - that score would have won the last three World Championships.\nIt was not all smooth, though, as she required strapping on her calf before her floor routine. She seemed in discomfort afterwards, limping a little, but still went on to top the standings in the all-around qualifying with three sub-divisions to go.\nWhen her bars dismount marked the end of her work for the day, it was then that it was clear what this had meant to her as the joy swept her face and she waved at the crowd before hugging her team-mates.\nThe 27-year-old will have to wait until later in the day to find out which finals she has made but at this stage it is looking good for team, all-around, vault, floor and beam.\n\nSimone Biles has four Olympic gold medals, one silver and two bronzes\nSub-division two of women's gymnastics qualifying was the hottest ticket in town, with rapper Snoop Dogg, actor Tom Cruise, Vogue editor Anna Wintour and singer Ariana Grande among those at the arena to watch Biles.\nIt seemed fitting that Biles began her day on beam - the last apparatus on which she competed at Tokyo 2020, taking an emotional bronze after skipping her other individual finals to focus on her mental health.\nHer warm-up drew excitement from fans as if it was the real thing, while the photographers' cameras went into overdrive.\nBut she was not fazed - or at least, not that we saw.\nShe delivered her acrobatic skills on the 10cm-wide apparatus with confidence, nailed a delightful triple spin and a complex twisting dismount to score 14.733.\nShe opened her floor routine with her eponymous Biles II - a triple-twisting double somersault - and while she stepped out of the floor area, it did not matter as the performance was packed with so many high-value skills it scored 14.600.\nShe paused afterwards to sit on a step, raising concerns her left ankle might be bothering her, and she crawled along the runway after a warm-up vault. But she was soon powering down it to perform the Biles II, which she introduced last year. It was not as good as the one she had stuck earlier in the week in training but still earned her a huge 15.800.\nCoach Cecile Landi told reporters Biles had \"just a little pain in her calf\". \nThere was a ripple of excitement as the American approached the uneven bars - was she about to become the only active gymnast to have a skill named after her on every apparatus, a sort of gymnastics skills grand slam?\nBut she played it safer with a routine that scored 14.433, which will probably not be enough to book a spot in that apparatus final.\nShe is still very likely to have other opportunities in the team and all-around finals to try that new skill though.\nJust another reason why she will have left many people feeling excited for what might come next from her at these Games as seeks to add to her seven Olympic medals.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Biles produces stunning beam display on Olympics return\nThe USA team have been keeping the pressure off Biles this week and the gymnast once again opted against speaking to reporters on her way out of the arena.\nBut there were plenty of others who had a lot to say about what they had witnessed. \n\"Just to be back, it's incredible that she is here to write a different ending,\" Matt Baker said on BBC TV. \n\"In my eyes she is the ultimate athlete here at these Olympic Games. Those scores are just going to keep on coming because Simone Biles is back where she belongs.\"\nRetired gymnast Louis Smith added: \"She's really showing why she's the best in the world at gymnastics. This amount of pressure and it's not fazing her. \n\"She is phenomenal. She looks in great shape. She is the Usain Bolt of this sport.\"\nGreat Britain's Becky Downie, who competed in the sub-division before Biles, told reporters: \"We probably won't see anyone like Simone again for a long time - it's really exciting what she brings to the sport.\"\n\"It's incredible that she's come back.\"\n\nToday's Olympics guide\nFull Paris Olympics schedule\nBBC's Paris Olympics TV schedule"

        "content": "This video can not be played\nKimberley Woods takes kayak bronze\nGreat Britain’s Kimberley Woods clinched Olympic bronze in a dramatic women’s kayak single (K1) final at the Vaires-Sur-Marne Nautical Stadium.\nThe 28-year-old qualified third-fastest with an impressive semi-final performance and produced another clean run in the final, clocking 98.94 seconds to clinch her first Olympic medal.\nWoods, third from last to start, moved into second behind Australia's gold medal winner Jessica Fox but was pushed down into bronze by Poland’s Klaudia Zwolinska.\nWith Woods’ fate in the hands of Germany’s reigning champion Ricarda Funk, the Tokyo gold medallist made a major mistake, receiving a 50-second penalty for missing the 20th gate of 23 to miss out on the podium.\nWoods celebrated with her team after her medal was confirmed, three years after her Olympic debut ended in tears as her final run fell apart and she finished last.\nWith redemption achieved, she will now target gold in kayak cross next week - a discipline making its Olympic debut in Paris and in which she is the reigning world champion.\nTop five stories from day two of Paris Olympics 2024\nWho are Team GB's medal winners at Paris 2024?\nWoods emulated Helen Reeves, winner of bronze in Athens 20 years ago, as only the second British woman to make a K1 podium at an Olympic Games.\nCommentating for BBC TV, Reeves said: \"What a way to start for Woods! She is like a different paddler. She has paddled brilliantly and upped her game throughout, run-on-run.\n\"I felt really confident coming out of the heats for her. All of the work they have been doing has all come together and it is very well deserved.\"\nAustralian Fox only qualified eighth fastest for the final but appeared the gold medallist in waiting after crossing the line in 96.08secs, a time which remained unbeaten ahead of Zwolinska (97.53).\nKimberley Woods won bronze after a dramatic final run\nWoods’ Olympic medal is a fitting reward for an athlete who has displayed extraordinary resilience throughout her life, overcoming adversity and repeated setbacks in pursuit of medals in an unforgiving sport, where the biggest prizes are settled by the finest margins.\nIn Tokyo she was consoled by team-mates by the side of the course after a missed gate contributed to 56 penalty seconds.\nBut here, at a raucous canoe slalom venue in front of an energetic crowd, misfortune befell Funk to ensure Woods' perfect run - celebrated with a beaming smile as she launched her paddle into the water - earned her bronze.\nBefore Tokyo, Woods revealed she had overcome years of childhood bullying, depression and self harm to reach her first Games.\nLittle over a month after those Games, Woods was involved in a car accident which left her in a wheelchair one week before the 2021 World Championships.\nNot only did she compete in Slovakia, but Woods left with women's K1 bronze – her first individual world medal.\nIt was last year that Woods truly established herself as gold-medal contender in Paris, winning her first global title in kayak cross, along with canoe single (C1) silver behind team-mate Mallory Franklin.\nAnd so, this time, with the confidence provided by world gold and the experience of a first Games to call upon, Woods delivered the moment she had long dreamed of before celebrating an emotional success with family and friends under the Paris sun.\n\"That whole journey of where I've come from in the last 10 years, it's been incredible and I'm really proud of who I am today, and be able to be open and speak about it and use my platform for good,\" said Woods.\n\"It just makes everything worth it. I think the journey I've been on, that first moment of admitting that I do need help, I think that's kind of where I go back to. It's OK to do that. It's OK to seek out help.\"\n\nToday's Olympics guide\nFull Paris Olympics schedule\nBBC's Paris Olympics TV schedule"

        "content": "The Paris Olympics are well under way so what better way to plan ahead than with our day-by-day guide - all times BST. \nTeam GB has named a squad of 327 athletes and UK Sport has set a target of 50 to 70 medals at the Games. \nThere will be live coverage of Paris 2024 across the BBC on TV, radio and online. \nThe Games officially opened at a unique and spectacular opening ceremony along the River Seine on Friday, 26 July and will close on Sunday, 11 August.\nFull Paris 2024 schedule\nAll you need to know about the Paris 2024 Olympics\nGold medal events:\nArchery (women's team), canoe slalom (women's K1), fencing (men's epee, women's foil), judo (W -52kg, M -66kg), mountain bike (women's cross-country), shooting (men and women's 10m air pistol), skateboard (women's street), swimming (men's 400m individual medley, women's 100m fly, men's 100m breast).\nHow to follow Paris 2024 Olympics across the BBC\nHighlights\nTeam GB’s Adam Peaty will challenge for a third consecutive men's 100m breaststroke Olympic title in Sunday’s final at 20:44 BST. This time, he has described himself as \"the person with the bow and arrow and not the one being fired at\" after a foot injury and time away from the sport to focus on his mental health. He was third at the World Championships in February. His key rivals are likely to be China's Qin Haiyang and American Nic Fink.\nMeanwhile, French swimming superstar Leon Marchand should line up in the final of the men's 400m individual medley at 19:30. Marchand is one of the biggest names on the hosts' Olympic team and is expected to end a 12-year French gold-medal drought in the pool. When he was younger, Marchand wrote to American great Michael Phelps’ former coach Bob Bowman to ask if he would be his coach. Bowman said yes and Marchand now has five world titles at the age of 22.\nTeam GB's Evie Richards, the 2021 world champion, features in the women’s cross-country mountain bike event from 13:10. Richards is coming back from a concussion suffered in Brazil two months ago, so does not start the race as one of the favourites, but is still ranked inside the world's top 15. Switzerland's Alessandra Keller is the world number one. Watch out for young Dutch star Puck Pieterse and France's Pauline Ferrand-Prevot.\nChelsie Giles is the headline act in GB’s judo squad for Paris 2024. The 27-year-old won bronze in Tokyo then added European gold and world silver a year later. Giles is in the -52kg class, which is packed with talent such as Japan's Uta Abe, who has proved a hard obstacle for Giles to overcome in the past and has been sweeping up medals lately. GB have won 20 Olympic medals in judo but never a gold, meaning there is history on the line. Women's medal contests begin at 16:49.\nIt is impossible to look past South Korea in most archery events - and that includes the women's team event, which they have won every time since it was introduced to the Olympics in 1988. Not only were none of the current GB team born then, but their coach was four years old. However, this GB team are made of strong stuff. Penny Healey and Bryony Pitman have each been ranked world number one in the past year, so this could be a real opportunity for them to shine. The event begins at 08:30 with the gold-medal match at 16:11.\nThis video can not be played\nParis 2024: Max Whitlock's amazing Olympic career through art\nBrit watch\nAndy Murray will get his final event before retiring under way. He won Olympic gold in London and Rio but is not playing singles at Paris 2024. He is in the doubles though with Dan Evans at Roland Garros. They are due on the Suzanne Lenglen court at about 17:00 and face Japanese duo Kei Nishikori and Taro Daniel.\nHelen Glover, an Olympic rowing champion in 2012 and 2016, is back for her fourth Olympics. This time she is in the women’s four alongside returning Olympian Rebecca Shorten and debutants Esme Booth and Sam Redgrave (no relation to Sir Steve). They only got together at the start of the year but were unbeaten at a string of major events in the first half of 2024. Sunday’s rowing begins at 08:00, with the women’s four heats from 11:30.\nAt the women’s rugby sevens, Team GB face Ireland in the opening group game at 14:30. GB have finished fourth at the past two Olympics, whereas this is the Irish women’s Olympic debut. Ireland go on to play South Africa at 18:00, while GB play Australia at 18:30.\nKimberley Woods will line up for GB in canoe slalom's K1 event (starts 14:30, final at 16:45). Woods had a \"heartbreaking\" Tokyo Games, finishing 10th, but believes she has grown mentally and physically in the years since. She is a contender in both this event and the kayak cross, which is making its Olympic debut later in the Games.\nEventing heads into its second day, the cross-country, from 09:30. This involves a gallop of nine to 10 minutes through the park at Versailles, twice crossing the centuries-old Grand Canal in what might be one of the Paris Olympics' signature views.\nIn women’s hockey, Team GB begin their campaign against Spain at 12:15. GB beat Spain in a quarter-final shootout in Tokyo before going on to win bronze. Later on Sunday, at 19:15, the GB men play their second group game against South Africa.\nWorld watch\nIn gymnastics, it is the women's turn to head through qualifying. Britain are again in the first subdivision at 08:30. The United States and China are in subdivision two from 10:40. Team GB's women took team bronze in Tokyo three years ago. The US, who are the defending world champions, are led once again by Simone Biles – now competing in her third Olympic Games aged 27, with a coincidental total of 27 world and Olympic titles already won.\nMen's water polo begins on Sunday and is part one of the day’s Franco-Hungarian action. Water polo is often described as the national sport of Hungary, who won 2023's world title and have nine Olympic gold medals in this event, although none since 2008. What better way to start than against the hosts? France have a tradition of winning the Olympic men's water polo title whenever it's held in Paris – which unfortunately for them has only happened once, a century ago. France play Hungary at 18:30.\nExpert knowledge\nIn women's street skateboarding, where teenagers are often contenders, France will be represented by 14-year-old Lucie Schoonheere. Nobody in the top 10 of this event's world rankings heading into the Olympics is aged older than 19. Japan's Coco Yoshizawa, also 14, is the world number one. The final begins at 16:00.\nNo sport has provided France with more Olympic medals than fencing – 123 of them at the start of Paris 2024, 30 more than cycling in second place. This brings us to part two of the day's Franco-Hungarian action. If the Hungarians are the strong favourites against France in water polo, the men's epee might give France more of a chance. Hungary’s Gergely Siklosi and Mate Koch are the world number one and two respectively, but when Siklosi lost the Olympic final in 2021, who beat him? France's Romain Cannone. Cannone and veteran team-mate Yannick Borel are both in the world top five and on the team for Paris 2024. Japan and Italy will also be hoping to have a say. Expect the medal events in men's epee and women's foil from about 19:50.\nThe young stars to follow at Paris 2024\nThis video can not be played\nParis 2024: Adam Peaty watches emotional messages from family & friends\nGold medal events:\nArchery (men's team), artistic gymnastics (men's team), canoe slalom (men's C1), diving (men's synchro 10m platform), equestrian (eventing jumping team, eventing jumping individual), fencing (men foil, women sabre), judo (W -57kg, M -73kg), mountain bike (men's cross-country), shooting (men's and women's 10m air rifle),  skateboard (men's street) - swimming (women's 400m individual medley, men's 200m free, men's 100m back, women's 100m breaststroke, women's 200m free).\nHighlights \nTom Daley, now 30, is back for his fifth Olympic Games representing Team GB. He is paired with 24-year-old Noah Williams in the men’s 10m synchro, an event in which Daley won a dramatic Tokyo gold alongside Matty Lee. Daley and Williams are top-ranked coming into Paris 2024 but the rankings do not fully account for the threat from China, whose pairing of Lian Junjie and Hao Yang have won the past three world titles. The final starts at 10:00.\nIn swimming, GB’s line-up for the men’s 200m freestyle is so strong that Tom Dean, who won Olympic gold in Tokyo, does not make the start list. Instead, Team GB will look to 2023 world champion Matt Richards and Tokyo silver medallist Duncan Scott. Watch out for Romania’s David Popovici, who is a second faster than anyone else this year heading into the event (final starts 19:43).\nTom Pidcock is in the middle of an exhausting 2024. He arrives at the Paris Olympics immediately after Covid forced him out of the Tour de France, and then he will compete not just in road cycling but also in mountain biking’s cross-country event, which starts at 13:10. Pidcock’s electric performance to win this event three years ago was a British highlight in Tokyo, and he says defending that title is his priority.\nIn the men’s team gymnastics final (from 16:30), GB have a shot at the podium. China and Japan have looked a class apart in recent years, but the Brits were third at the 2022 world championships and narrowly beaten into fourth by the US a year later. Max Whitlock was in the team that won bronze at London 2012 and has since had to endure back-to-back fourth-place Olympic finishes in this event.\nEventing reaches its last day of action, concluding with showjumping from 10:00. Will GB be able to take back-to-back titles? The British are fielding an extraordinarily strong team but jumping is one of those sports where a first tiny error can rapidly become a catastrophe. Anything could happen, no matter how the dressage and cross-country set things up.\nBrit watch \nAdam Burgess was 0.16 seconds away from a medal in canoe slalom’s C1 event at the Tokyo Games. Burgess has embarked on what he calls “project send it” ahead of Paris – learning to “send it a little bit more in the final” to make sure he can truly compete for medals on the Olympic stage. Also sending it from 14:30 will be Benjamin Savsek, the Slovenian who won gold in Tokyo and remains one of the top-ranked in the world.\nSeonaid McIntosh, from a shooting family, took European silver in the 10m air rifle last year and is inside the top 20 worldwide. The final starts at 08:30. Michael Bargeron competes in the men’s event from 11:00.\nIn hockey, Ireland’s men play Australia at 09:00 before GB’s women play Australia at 16:00. In rugby sevens, GB’s women play South Africa at 13:00. Ireland play Australia at 13:30.\nWorld watch \nFrom 16:00, skateboarding’s men’s street final - postponed from Saturday - could be dominated by Japan. Yuto Horigome is back after winning gold on home soil three years ago, and he is joined by 2023 world champion Sora Shirai. French hopes rest with world number nine and 2022 world champion Aurelien Giraud. For the US, legend of the sport Nyjah Huston is hoping to make up for missing out on a medal in Tokyo.\nBack at the swimming, the women’s 100m breaststroke (20:32) could become a battle royale. Team USA’s Lilly King is back in the mix after winning gold in 2016, as is Tokyo silver medallist Tatjana Smith, while Lithuania’s Ruta Meilutyte could also feature. China’s Tang Qianting is the world champion and this year’s standout performer.\nOlha Kharlan is one of Ukraine’s biggest Olympic names, a four-time world champion in women’s sabre and a four-time Olympic fencing medallist. Kharlan qualified for Paris 2024 in unusual circumstances. She did not shake the hand of Russia’s Anna Smirnova at last year's World Championships, Smirnova protested, and Kharlan was disqualified. The International Olympic Committee stepped in to guarantee Kharlan a place at the Games. The women’s sabre final, which Kharlan will hope to reach, takes place from 20:45.\nExpert knowledge\nSouth Korea are again the dominant force in men’s team archery (medal matches from 15:48), but there is just a chance that Turkey disrupt that this year. Led by Tokyo individual champion Mete Gazoz, Turkey ranked a lowly seventh after the qualifying round at last year’s World Championships but picked off the Netherlands and Japan in back-to-back come-from-behind victories to set up a final with South Korea. They lost, but Turkey coach Goktug Ergin has already proclaimed his team ready to fight for medals. It is the country’s first Olympic appearance in this event for 24 years.\nThis video can not be played\nParis Olympics 2024: Team GB swimming team-mates take on painting challenge\nGold medal events:\nArtistic gymnastics (women's team final), fencing (women's epee team), judo (women's -63kg, men's -81 kg), rugby sevens (women's), shooting (mixed team 10m air pistol, men's trap), surfing (men's and women's), swimming (women's 100m back, men's 800m free, men's 4x200m free relay), table tennis (mixed doubles), triathlon (men's individual).\nHighlights\nTop coaches have described the Paris triathlon course as “insane”. It is, at least, in-Seine. You start from the Pont Alexandre III bridge in view of the Eiffel Tower, swim 1,500m in the Seine – two downstream sections and one upstream – then run up a set of posh steps to start the 40km bike course, which introduced some cobbled stretches into the mix. Lastly, there is a 10km run back along the same course.\nIt promises to be a spectacular and challenging event, even by Olympic triathlon standards, and GB’s Alex Yee will hope to be at the front of the action in the men's event. Yee won Olympic silver in a pulsating Tokyo contest three years ago. Norwegian Kristian Blummenfelt, who pulled past Yee to win gold that day, is back but has since moved up to Ironman distance then back down again, and it remains to be seen if he will master that transition. The race starts at 07:00.\nWomen’s team gymnastics is one of the Olympics’ worldwide blockbuster events. The United States will expect one of its largest TV audiences of the Games for Simone Biles and compatriots, assuming they qualify for Tuesday’s final, which begins at 17:15. Becky Downie, back in the British team for a third Olympics, is tasked with helping to steer GB towards a podium finish. The women’s team event is intensely competitive right now, and any of six or seven nations could take a medal, with the absence of Russian athletes also opening up the contest.\nThere is lots going on in swimming's evening session. Team GB have a real chance of gold in the men’s 4x200m freestyle relay, having won the Olympic title in Tokyo and the world title in 2023. Tom Dean, James Guy, Matt Richards and Duncan Scott are all veterans of both victories and are in the line-up. The relay starts at 20:59. The women’s 100m backstroke at 19:57 is expected to feature Australia’s Kaylee McKeown, a three-time champion in Tokyo, against the likes of American Regan Smith and Canada’s Kylie Masse.\nBrit watch\nIt is day one of dressage. Yes, you did just see dressage a few days ago. That was eventing dressage. This is dressage dressage, where GB have an extremely accomplished team. The event begins at 10:00.\nFreestyle BMX begins with qualifiers featuring GB’s Kieran Reilly and Charlotte Worthington (12:25 onward). Reilly is the men’s world champion and Worthington is the Olympic champion. In the men’s event, France’s Anthony Jeanjean is an imposing threat to Reilly, particularly having demonstrated he can entertain a home crowd with a World Cup win in Montpellier leading up the Games. Australia’s Logan Martin is defending his Tokyo title.\nJoe Clarke, who won canoe slalom gold in Rio eight years ago but was left out of the GB team for Tokyo in 2021, is back for Paris and begins his K1 event with the heats from 15:00. Mallory Franklin, the women’s C1 Tokyo silver medallist and world champion, starts her heats at 14:00.\nGB men's hockey team play the Netherlands, the only team with a better world ranking, in their group at 11:45. Ireland play India at 12:15.\nTokyo bronze medallist Matthew Coward-Holley and 2022 world silver medallist Nathan Hales will hope to be in the men’s trap shooting final from 14:30. Coward-Holley comes into the Games ranked third in the world behind Spain’s Alberto Fernandez and Australia’s James Willett.\nWorld watch\nA win on home turf would give France’s Tokyo opening ceremony flagbearer, Clarisse Agbegnenou, a third Olympic judo gold alongside the -63kg and mixed team titles she won three years ago. Lucy Renshall is GB’s representative in the event. Medal contests from 16:49.\n3x3 basketball is making its second Olympic appearance after a debut in Tokyo, offering a street version of the game using half a court. Latvia won the first 3x3 Olympic men’s title three years ago and begin their defence against Lithuania (17:35), who proved a surprise package at the 2022 World Championships, getting all the way to the final with victories against teams including France and the US.\nSurfing presents a dilemma for writers of day-by-day guides: if it starts on Tuesday and goes through the night into Wednesday, where to put it? In case you want to follow the whole thing: the quarter-finals begin at 18:00 on Tuesday, the semi-finals will go past midnight, the men’s gold-medal contest will be at 02:34 on Wednesday and the women’s final will be at 03:15. Remember, this is because the surfing is in Tahiti, which is 12 hours behind France.\nThe US will expect to win the women’s surfing title with the likes of Olympic champion Carissa Moore and world champion Caroline Marks on the team, but watch out for Brazil’s Tatiana Weston-Webb, Costa Rica’s Brisa Hennessy and France’s Vahine Fierro, who used to live in Tahiti and trains there. On the men’s side, Brazil’s Gabriel Medina and US surfer John John Florence are two out of a dozen or more names in with a serious chance of winning. Tahitian Kauli Vaast, surfing for France, is an underdog who could exploit his local knowledge.\nWomen’s rugby sevens reaches the final at 18:45. Will GB improve on fourth place in Tokyo? Can France go one better than last time and clinch gold on home soil? Will New Zealand be all-conquering again, or can Australia get back to their winning ways of 2016?\nExpert knowledge\nThe Dominican Republic's men's football team, whose squad includes Leeds defender Junior Firpo, are playing fellow Olympic debutants Uzbekistan (14:00). This might be both teams' best shot at a result if tough encounters against Egypt and Spain do not go their way.\nSomething jaw-dropping happened at Tokyo 2020: China failed to win one of the table tennis gold medals. To put this in perspective, China have won 32 of the 37 Olympic table tennis titles ever contested, and the one they missed in Tokyo was the first the country had not won since 2004. To rub salt into that wound, it was a new event, the mixed doubles, where Japan’s Jun Mizutani and Mima Ito pulled off a come-from-behind win over Chinese rivals for gold on home soil. Could China possibly be denied again? Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha are the world number one-ranked duo coming into the Paris 2024 mixed doubles, which concludes with the final at 13:30.\nGold medal events:\nArtistic gymnastics (men's individual all-around), BMX freestyle (men's and women's), canoe slalom (women's C1), diving (women's synchro 10m platform), fencing (men's sabre team), judo (women's-70kg, men's -90kg), rowing (men's quadruple sculls, women's quadruple sculls), shooting (women's trap), swimming (women's 100m free, men's 200m fly, women's 1500m free, men's 200m breast, men's 100m free), triathlon (women's individual).\nHighlights\nWednesday is the women’s turn to take on the Paris triathlon course from 07:00. Team GB have a very strong team in world champion Beth Potter, Tokyo individual silver medallist Georgia Taylor-Brown and world top 10-ranked Kate Waugh. France’s Cassandre Beaugrand and Emma Lombardi are also contenders for gold at their home Games.\nThe men's all-around gymnastics final begins at 16:30, an event where athletes compete on all six apparatus to decide the best overall gymnast at the Olympics. Max Whitlock made it on to the Rio podium in this event eight years ago, but defending champion and multiple world title-winner Daiki Hashimoto is the favourite.\nWe reach the freestyle BMX finals from 12:10, where GB’s Charlotte Worthington and Kieran Reilly are proven champions on the world stage. This is freestyle’s second Olympic appearance. To win gold, perform as many tricks as you can in 60 seconds and make sure they are better than anyone else’s.\nDepending on how Tuesday’s heats went, Wednesday could bring a medal opportunity for GB’s Mallory Franklin in the C1 women’s canoe slalom (final from 16:25). Australia’s Jessica Fox, one of the greatest canoeists of all time and the Tokyo champion, will be one of Franklin’s biggest rivals. Watch out for Elena Lilik, who beat Andrea Herzog – Tokyo’s bronze medallist – to claim Germany’s sole entry in this event.\nBrit watch\nRowing’s quadruple sculls finals begin at 11:26. Britain are the world champions in the women’s event and picked up 2022 world silver in the men’s race.\nIn shooting, Lucy Hall, a European silver medallist in 2022, will hope to feature in the women’s trap final at 14:30.\nJemima Yeats-Brown lost her sister and biggest fan, Jenny, to brain cancer just after winning Commonwealth judo bronze in 2022. Yeats-Brown says that has helped inspire a “life’s too short” approach to competing that helped her secure fifth at the World Championships in 2023. She fights in the -70kg category, where medal contests start at 16:18.\nIn hockey, GB’s women play South Africa at 09:30.\nWorld watch\nThe 100m freestyle contest at the pool (21:15) is a chance to see Caeleb Dressel, regarded as one of the greatest sprinters in US and world swimming, defending his Tokyo title. There is a lot of hype coming into Paris about David Popovici, a superstar of the Romanian team, but he had a tough 2023. This is a chance for Popovici to make an impact after finishing seventh in Tokyo aged just 16, while Matt Richards and Duncan Scott swim for GB. Also watch for Anna Hopkin in the women’s 100m freestyle (19:30), James Wilby in the men’s 200m breaststroke (21:08) and American Katie Ledecky in the women’s 1,500m free (20:04).\nIn men’s basketball the US-South Sudan game (20:00) pits one of the most dominant teams in Olympic history against a first-time entrant. South Sudan became an independent state in 2011 and its basketball federation joined world governing body Fiba in 2013, so getting to the Olympics about a decade later is pretty good going, to put it mildly.\nAt the heart of that story? Luol Deng, who played basketball for GB at London 2012. Deng, who spent a decade playing for the NBA’s Chicago Bulls, holds British and South Sudanese citizenship. For years as a coach, he has been a driving force (and financial force) behind the South Sudan team’s rise to Olympic status. Facing the US in Paris may be the pinnacle of that incredible story arc.\nExpert knowledge \nLois Toulson and Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix come into Paris 2024 as history-makers before they even start their first dive. The duo won world silver last year, the first time Britain had won any women’s diving medal at that level. If they win another medal here – the women’s 10m synchro diving final starts at 10:00 – watch for some cartwheels on the BBC studio sofa, as Andrea’s dad is Fred Sirieix, star of First Dates turned BBC presenter at Paris 2024.\nGold medal events:\nArtistic gymnastics (women's individual all-around), athletics (men's and women's 20km race walk), canoe slalom (men K1), fencing (women's foil team), judo (women's -78kg, men's -100kg), rowing (women's double sculls, men's double sculls, women's coxless four, men's coxless four), sailing (men's and women's skiff), shooting (men's 50m rifle 3 positions) and swimming (women's 200m fly, men's 200m back, women's 200m breast, women's 4x200m free relay).\nHighlights\nBritish rowers are used to heaps of gold medals – more than 30 of them in Olympic rowing. GB were the top rowing nation at Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016. Then came Tokyo and not one gold. They were 14th in the rowing medal table, which was a shock.\nThursday might be the day we know if the Brits are turning that ship around. Helen Glover will hope to lead an impressive women’s four in the final at 10:50, while the men’s four won the world title in both 2022 and 2023. Their final is at 11:10. The space of about half an hour could play a huge role in deciding if this Olympic regatta is a GB return to form.\nThe rowers are not the only ones who had a Tokyo to forget. Joe Clarke did not make the team despite being the defending Olympic champion in K1 slalom canoeing. Now, he is back and will hope to be a big factor in the Paris final from 16:30.\nThe women’s all-around gymnastics final at 17:15 could see some remarkable history being made. If they are both healthy and nominated for this event, American duo Simone Biles and Sunisa Lee could make this the first women’s all-around final in which the past two Olympic champions have competed. Biles won in 2016, followed by Lee in 2020. If either of them wins gold, they will be the first woman to win multiple Olympic all-around titles since Vera Caslavska in 1964 and 1968.\nBrit watch\nGolf found its way back on to the Olympic schedule in 2016 after more than a century in the wilderness (or perhaps deep rough). At Paris 2024, the course is L’Albatros at Le Golf National in the Paris suburbs, which hosted the Ryder Cup in 2018. The first round of the men’s event starts at 08:00 and features GB’s Matt Fitzpatrick and Tommy Fleetwood, Ireland’s Rory McIlroy and a host of the sport’s other big names.\nLuke Greenbank will hope to better his Tokyo bronze medal in the men’s 200m backstroke (19:37) at the pool. Meanwhile, Team GB have been top-four material of late in the women’s 4x200m freestyle relay so could pose a medal threat there too (20:48).\nBeth Shriever has remained dominant in BMX racing since winning Olympic gold in Tokyo. However, she fractured her collarbone at the sport’s World Championships in May, meaning one of GB’s big medal hopes has faced a race against time. From 19:20 we will see how that comeback has progressed as the early stages of her event take place. In the men’s event, Olympic and world silver medallist Kye Whyte is returning from a back injury of his own.\nIn hockey, GB’s men take on hosts France at 11:45, Ireland’s men play Argentina at 12:15 and GB’s women face the US at 16:00.\nShowjumping begins with the team qualifier from 10:00. Scott Brash and Ben Maher, who were part of Britain’s gold medal-winning team at London 2012, are joined this time around by Harry Charles.\nWorld watch\nBack at the pool, Katie Ledecky may have a shot at some Olympic history by this point in the Games. If she has won two medals by this point – very possible, given the 200m free and 400m free will have been and gone, and she has won golds in both in the past – then a medal in the 4x200m freestyle relay (20:48) would be her 13th overall, a record for a US female Olympian. (Three American women, all of them swimmers, have previously reached 12: Jenny Thompson, Dara Torres and Natalie Coughlin.)\nThe men’s and women’s 20km race walks begin at 06:30 and 08:20 respectively. Chinese veteran Liu Hong, the 2016 women’s champion, is trying to end a run of five years – ages, by her standards – without a major title. Spain’s Maria Perez is the world champion, having been on the brink of quitting the sport in 2022 after back-to-back disqualifications at that year’s European and world championships. Another Spanish athlete, Alvaro Martin, is the men’s world champion.\nAt Roland Garros, we reach the first tennis semi-finals from 11:00.\nExpert knowledge\nThe first sailing medals of the Games will be awarded in the skiff class. For the men, this means the 49er, and for the women it is the 49er FX (a version designed to work with a lighter two-person crew than the 49er).\nSaskia Tidey is at her third Olympics and representing her second country in sailing.  Tidey sailed for Ireland in 2016, then switched to GB for Tokyo once it became apparent that she had no suitable Irish partner available in the two-person event. Tidey and GB team-mate Charlotte Dobson finished sixth three years ago, and now Tidey is back with new partner Freya Black. The two were European bronze medallists in May.\nGB’s James Peters and Fynn Sterritt, in the men’s event, said before the Games they had been trying to put on weight after realising they were one of the lighter boats in the men’s fleet. Britain are the defending champions in this event after Dylan Fletcher and Stuart Bithell won gold three years ago.\n\nGold medal events:\nArchery (mixed team), athletics (men's 10,000m), badminton (mixed doubles), BMX racing (men's and women's), diving (men's synchro 3m springboard), equestrian (jumping team), fencing (men's epee team), judo (women's +78kg, men's +100kg), rowing (men's coxless pair, women's coxless pair, men's lightweight double sculls, women's lightweight double sculls), sailing (men's and women's windsurfing), shooting (women's 50m rifle 3 positions), swimming (men's 50m free, women's 200m back, men's 200m individual medley), tennis (mixed doubles), trampoline gymnastics (women's and men's).\nHighlights\nKeely Hodgkinson, tipped to be one of Team GB’s biggest stars in Paris, appears for the first time in the 800m heats from 18:45. The 22-year-old is hoping to upgrade Tokyo silver to gold in 2024. Earlier, Dina Asher-Smith will be in the opening stages of the women’s 100m from 10:50. She, like Hodgkinson, won the European title in her event last month.\nJack Laugher will dive with his third different partner in as many Olympics when he competes in the men’s 3m synchro diving from 10:00. Anthony Harding is Laugher’s team-mate this time. They have won two world silver medals together, each time behind China. Laugher won this event with Chris Mears at Rio 2016.\nIt is BMX racing finals day. If Beth Shriever and Kye Whyte have recovered from pre-Games injuries and are still in the running, they will have to negotiate the semi-finals before the gold-medal races from 20:35. Both riders are in the world’s top six. France have a trio of highly rated riders on the men’s side, while Australia’s Saya Sakakibara is seeking redemption in the women’s event after a semi-final crash in Tokyo.\nBryony Page stunned the field when she took the first Olympic trampoline medal in Britain’s history, silver in 2016. She added bronze in Tokyo and has won two of the past three world titles, setting up one another bid for gold aged 33 before she pursues her dream of joining the acrobats at Cirque du Soleil. Qualifying is at 11:00 before the final at 12:50.\nLightweight scullers Emily Craig and Imogen Grant missed a medal in the women’s lightweight double sculls by 0.01 seconds in Tokyo. Since then, they have won back-to-back world titles and are considered one of the British rowing team’s best hopes for gold in Paris. The final takes place at 11:22.\nIn sailing, windsurfing reaches its final day. This year’s windsurfing event involves a new class, iQFoil, which replaces the old RS:X class. The way the IOC explains the difference is that “instead of floating, the board appears to fly” in the iQFoil class because of hydrofoils that lift the board out of the water at certain speeds. Emma Wilson, who won RS:X bronze in Tokyo, has world silver and bronze medals in iQFoil and will hope to be going for a podium place on Friday.\nBrit watch\nSwimming on Friday features GB’s Ben Proud versus American Caeleb Dressel in the men’s 50m freestyle (final at 19:30). Dressel is the Tokyo Olympic champion, while Proud has a gold and two bronzes from the past three World Championships. Australia’s Cameron McEvoy will also be hoping for a medal.\nIn shooting, world number one Seonaid McIntosh takes aim in the women’s 50m rifle three positions from 08:30. The “three positions” part means you shoot kneeling, prone (lying down) and standing.\nFriday’s equestrian highlight is the team jumping final at 13:00, featuring a British team who took world bronze behind Sweden and the Netherlands in 2022.\nIn hockey, Ireland’s men play New Zealand at 16:00, followed by GB against Germany at 19:15.\nWorld watch\nReturning to the pool, the men’s 200m individual medley (19:49) offers an opportunity for French swimming star Leon Marchand to try to surpass Ryan Lochte’s world record time. Lochte’s record is one minute 54.00 seconds, while Marchand got down to 1:54.82 in winning world gold ahead of GB’s Duncan Scott and Tom Dean last year. Tokyo silver medallist Scott and Dean will hope to make the Paris final, while Tokyo champion Wang Shun of China is back. In the men's 50m freestyle, France will be cheering for Florent Manaudou, London 2012 gold medallist in the event and one of the hosts’ two flagbearers at the opening ceremony.\nUganda’s Joshua Cheptegei has dominated the men’s 10,000m but was beaten by Ethiopia’s Selemon Barega in an extraordinarily humid Tokyo 2020 final. Both are back for 2024 and this is the only title on offer during the opening night of athletics (20:20).\nBadminton’s mixed doubles final (15:10) is highly likely to have at least one Chinese entry and it would be no surprise if, like Tokyo, the final was between two Chinese teams. Three years ago, Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong were defeated by Wang Yilyu and Huang Dongping. Gold medallist Wang has since retired, so silver medallists Zheng and Huang Yaqiong may end up facing Huang Dongping and new partner Feng Yanzhe this time around.\nArchery’s mixed team final takes place from 15:43. In Tokyo, an arrow from South Korea’s An San hit and split an arrow shot by team-mate Kim Je-deok on their way to gold in this event. This is almost impossible to achieve and is known as a “Robin Hood arrow”. According to World Archery, this may have been the first time a Robin Hood arrow was ever filmed in competition. The two arrows are now on display at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland.\nTennis reaches the mixed doubles final and men’s singles semi-finals (11:00-20:00).\nThe men’s football quarter-finals take place in Paris, Lyon, Marseille and Bordeaux with kick-offs between 14:00 and 20:00.\nIn women’s 3x3 basketball, two of the world’s top-ranked nations – France and the US – meet at 12:00.\nExpert knowledge\nTeddy Riner will try to equal the Olympic judo record for three individual gold medals in front of his home crowd. The 100+kg event’s medal rounds begin at 16:49.\nRiner is virtually unbeatable. Between September 2010 and February 2020, he won 154 consecutive contests. At the Tokyo Olympics, he had to settle for bronze after losing to Russia’s Tamerlan Bashaev, his first defeat at the Games since 2008. He has not lost at Grand Slam or World Championship level since Tokyo.\nGold medal events:\nArchery (women's individual), artistic gymnastics (men's floor, women's vault, men's pommel horse finals), athletics (men's shot put, women's triple jump, mixed 4x400m relay, women's 100m, men's decathlon), badminton (women's doubles), equestrian (dressage grand prix special team), fencing (women's sabre team), judo (mixed team), road cycling (men's road race), rowing (women's single sculls, men's single sculls, women's eight, men's eight), shooting (women's 25m pistol, men's skeet), swimming (men's 100m fly, women's 200m individual medley, women's 800m free, mixed 4x100m medley relay), table tennis (women's singles), tennis (women's singles, men's doubles).\nHighlights\nBritain’s fastest female sprinter, Dina Asher-Smith, will hope to line up in the 100m final at 20:20. Asher-Smith has changed coach and moved to train in Texas since a disappointing eighth place in last year’s world final. “I want to win the Olympics and I want to run really fast,” she has said. Big rivals include US sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson and Jamaica’s Shericka Jackson. Richardson has the year’s leading mark of 10.71 seconds.\nAt 16:10, the pommel horse final is Max Whitlock’s chance to deliver on his aim of an unprecedented fourth consecutive medal on the same gymnastics apparatus. Ireland’s world champion and pommel horse specialist Rhys McClenaghan will have his sights on gold. The women’s vault final (15:20) may feature Simone Biles, the Rio 2016 champion, returning to an event from which she withdrew in Tokyo.\nThis is the last day of rowing and the very last final on the list is the men’s eight (10:10). Britain won this event in 2016 but New Zealand were the winners in Tokyo. GB have recovered to win the past two world titles. Defending champions Canada, Romania and the US are contenders in the women’s eight (09:50).\nDressage’s team event concludes from 09:00. GB have not been off the Olympic podium since a memorable victory at London 2012, but can they get back to the top step?\nBrit watch\nIt is the penultimate night at the pool. GB smashed the world record to win the mixed 4x100m medley relay (20:33) when it was held for the first time at the Tokyo Games. This is a great relay to watch as there is a heap of strategy involved in looking at your team’s strengths and weaknesses, then deciding who you put on which leg. It is often not clear which team’s plan is paying off until the final moments.\nCycling returns with the men’s road race (10:00). GB have qualified a full four-man team that features Tom Pidcock, who only just competed in Olympic mountain-biking last week, never mind half of the Tour de France before dropping out with Covid. The course reaches a climax with three laps of cobbled climb before a downhill stretch and a sprint towards the Trocadero.\nKayak cross is new at the Olympics. If you have seen snowboard cross at the Winter Olympics then – yes, that, except in whitewater. Instead of the usual Olympic slalom canoeing against the clock, paddlers race each other to the finish. They have to turn around in whitewater, flip their boats and perform all sorts of other manoeuvres along the way. The opening rounds begin at 14:30 and Team GB have some of the world’s best athletes.\nSaturday’s hockey includes GB’s women versus Argentina at 09:00.\nWorld watch\nSerena Williams, Monica Puig and Belinda Bencic are your last three women’s singles tennis champions at the Olympics. Who will it be this time? World number one Iga Swiatek has Olympic success in her blood – her dad, Tomasz Swiatek, was a rower for Poland at Seoul 1988. The hosts will pin their hopes on Caroline Garcia making it this far. This is also the day of the men’s doubles final, an event that includes Andy Murray and Dan Evans plus Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski for GB.\nElsewhere in the night’s swimming action, Katie Ledecky has a shot at a fourth consecutive gold in the women’s 800m freestyle (20:09). It could be close, though. Last time, in Tokyo, Ariarne Titmus was just a second behind her – the first time anyone had been within four seconds of Ledecky in an Olympic final over this distance.\nOn the track, the men’s 100m first round (from 10:45) allows us a first look at world champion Noah Lyles and Christian Coleman, both representing the US, as well as GB trio Zharnel Hughes, Louie Hinchliffe and Jeremiah Azu. Keep an eye out for “Africa’s fastest man” Ferdinand Omanyala of Kenya and Jamaican title challenger Kishane Thompson.\nThe decathlon concludes with the 1500m race at 20:45. France’s Kevin Mayer, a silver medallist in Tokyo and Rio, will be trying to upgrade that on home soil, although team-mate Makenson Gletty comes in with a better world ranking. Canada, boasting Olympic champion Damian Warner and world champion Pierce LePage, will be tough to beat.\nBadminton’s women’s doubles is a big target for Indonesia. Apriyani Rahayu won Tokyo gold with Greysia Polii and is now paired with Siti Fadia Silva Ramadhanti after Polii’s retirement. China’s Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan are the favourites. The two teams meet each other in the group stages, which may help set the scene for Saturday’s final (15:10).\nWomen football reaches the quarter-final stage with games kicking off at 14:00, 16:00, 18:00 and 20:00.\nExpert knowledge \nLedecky is not the only athlete capable of racking up a fourth gold medal in an event on Saturday. Skeet shooter Vincent Hancock won gold in Beijing, London and Tokyo for the US, a remarkable record marred only by finishing 15th in Rio. This time around, Hancock is coming in ranked 17th in the world.\nAs of the start of Saturday, only six people have won the same individual event four times at the Olympics: Denmark’s Paul Elvstrom in sailing, Americans Al Oerter and Carl Lewis in athletics, Japan’s Kaori Icho and Cuba’s Mijain Lopez in wrestling, and Michael Phelps for the US in swimming.\nNobody has ever won the same individual event five times at the Olympics (although it could happen in Paris – see Tuesday, 6 August). Ledecky at LA 2028, anyone?\nOlympic Games fan zones to be set up across the UK\nOlympics 2024: how extreme weather could impact Paris games\nGold medal events:\nArchery (men's individual), artistic gymnastics (men's rings, women's uneven bars, men's vault), athletics (women's high jump, men's hammer throw, men's 100m), badminton (men's doubles), equestrian (dressage grand prix freestyle individual), fencing (men's foil team), golf (men's round 4), road cycling (women's road race), shooting (women's skeet), swimming (women's 50m free, men's 1500m free, men's 4x100m medley relay, women's 4x100m medley relay), table tennis (men's singles), tennis (women's doubles and men's singles).\nHighlights\nSunday at 20:55 is go time for the men’s 100m final. Will Zharnel Hughes be on the start line for GB after a world bronze last year? Will Noah Lyles become the first American to win this event since 2004? Can Botswana’s Letsile Tebogo pull off an upgrade on last year’s world silver?\nRoland Garros hosts the Olympic men’s singles final. Many fans would love a Nadal-Djokovic Olympic final on clay here. They have met once before at the Games, in the Beijing 2008 semi-finals, which Nadal won. Realistically, the Spaniard may have a better chance of a medal in the doubles. Serbia's Djokovic, meanwhile, is trying to win the one big title still missing from his collection.\nThe final round of the men’s golf competition begins at 08:00. American Xander Schauffele will be in Paris to defend his title, and he has said an Olympic gold medal is proving increasingly valuable in a sport that, until Rio 2016, was all about its four majors. Spain’s Jon Rahm will be one of the highest-profile LIV Golf players at the Games.\nLizzie Deignan is the first female British cyclist to be selected for four Olympic Games. Deignan – the London 2012 silver medallist and 2015 world champion – is joined by national champion Pfeiffer Georgi, Anna Henderson and Anna Morris for Sunday’s women’s road race, which starts at 13:00. A strong Dutch team for this race features Ellen van Dijk, Demi Vollering, Lorena Wiebes and Marianne Vos, who won gold in London 12 years ago.\nBrit watch\nWith Charlotte Dujardin pulling out on Tuesday, team-mate Lottie Fry - daughter of Laura, who rode at Barcelona 1992 – could be one of the biggest challengers in this event.\nIn gymnastics, Jake Jarman won world vault gold last year and backed it up with a European title in April. The 22-year-old has the chance to turn that form into an Olympic title at 15:25. Becky Downie could be a contender in the uneven bars from 14:40.\nAmber Rutter welcomed her first child to the world in April. Now she’s shooting for skeet gold at Paris 2024 (qualification from 08:30, final from 14:30). Rutter missed Tokyo 2020 through a positive Covid test just before she travelled, which she says was devastating at the time but ultimately helped reshape her life goals to include both personal priorities and Olympic aims.\nIn track and field action, world silver medallist Matthew Hudson-Smith is in the opening round of the men’s 400m from 18:05.\nMen’s hockey reaches the quarter-final stages.\nWorld watch\nThe first round of the men’s 110m hurdles begins at 10:50. Grant Holloway was the Tokyo favourite until he “lost composure” in his words and allowed Jamaica’s Hansle Parchment to thunder past. Holloway has since won both available world titles and is on the US team for Paris. In the women’s 400m hurdles first round (11:35) watch for another American, defending champion Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, testing herself against Dutch world champion Femke Bol.\nThe last night of swimming at Paris 2024 (from 17:30) features four finals: the women’s 50m free, men’s 1,500m free, men’s 4x100m medley and women’s 4x100m medley. Sweden’s Sarah Sjostrom is a big contender in the women’s 50m free, while the women’s 4x100m medley could turn into a classic US-Australia battle. GB won men’s medley silver in Tokyo.\nThe table tennis men’s singles final could be an opportunity for China’s Ma Long to extend an extraordinary Olympic streak (13:30). Ma comes into the Games having won all five Olympic titles available to him since 2012 – three team, two individual.\nExpert knowledge\nWe are well into the quarter-finals and semi-finals of boxing’s various weights. In the women’s middleweight division (75kg), where quarter-finals take place on Sunday, UK-based Cindy Ngamba is fighting for the Olympic Refugee Team. Ngamba is unable to return to Cameroon, where she was born, because of her sexuality – homosexuality in the country is punishable with up to five years in prison. She is the first boxer ever selected for an Olympic refugee team.\nFencing at Paris 2024 concludes with men’s team foil (19:30), a perfect finale for the hosts, who are the defending champions. To score a point, you need to strike your opponent on their torso, shoulder or neck with the tip of your weapon. You also need to have “right of way” which, if you’re new to fencing, is a concept best left to the referee, who decides which fencer has attacking priority at any given time. In the team event, everyone cycles through a series of mini head-to-head match-ups until one team scores 45. Alternatively, the highest-scoring team wins if the ninth and final bout ends without either team reaching 45.\nGold medal events:\nArtistic gymnastics (men's parallel bars, women's balance beam, men's horizontal bar, women's floor), athletics (men's pole vault, women's discus throw, women's 5,000m, women's 800m), badminton (women's singles, men's singles), basketball 3x3 (men's and women's), canoe slalom (men's and women's kayak cross), shooting (men's 25m rapid fire pistol, mixed team skeet), track cycling (women's team sprint), triathlon (mixed team relay). \nHighlights\nIn a fast and dazzling Tokyo 800m final, Keely Hodgkinson delivered a sensational Olympic silver medal in a time that broke a British record set by Kelly Holmes in 1995. Three years later, can she go one better? Athing Mu, who took gold in Tokyo, will not be in Paris after falling during US Olympic trials, but Kenyan world champion Mary Moraa will. The final starts at 20:45.\nWhen mixed team triathlon (starts 07:00) was introduced to the Olympics in Tokyo, the GB team of Jonny Brownlee, Jess Learmonth, Georgia Taylor-Brown and Alex Yee won it. This time around, France and Germany are likely to be major medal threats.\nAction starts at the Velodrome de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, just west of Paris. Track cycling’s opening day includes the women’s team sprint (from 16:00, final 18:58), where GB have qualified a team for the first time since London 2012. Sophie Capewell helped GB to world silver in the event last year. Her dad, Nigel, recorded fourth-place finishes in Paralympic track cycling at Atlanta 1996 and Sydney 2000.\nKayak cross reaches a climax with the women’s final at 15:55 and men’s final at 16:00. GB’s Joe Clarke has back-to-back world titles in this event, which is new to the Olympics and features paddlers racing each other along the rapids. Clarke’s team-mate Kimberley Woods also won world gold last year. France are likely to be a big factor in both events.\nCould this be the last time you see Simone Biles in action? The beam final (11:36) and women's floor final (13:20) take place on artistic gymnastics’ last day at Paris 2024, which is 27-year-old Biles’ third Olympic Games. The beam final could see the baton passed to the next generation, since Hezly Rivera – at 16, the youngest athlete on the US team – won this event at US Olympic trials.\nBrit watch\nThe world might be focused on Biles but GB will be keeping an eye on Joe Fraser, who is a past world and European gold medallist on parallel bars. That final begins at 10:45.\nSport climbing, which made its debut at the Tokyo Olympics, returns from 09:00 with more medals this time around. What was one combined event in Tokyo is now two competitions in Paris. The first is boulder and lead, where climbers work to solve short but complex climbs in bouldering then go for maximum height in lead climbing, all of which is done in set time windows. The second is speed climbing, which is against the clock.\nThe change in format opens up new avenues for competitors like GB’s 19-year-old Toby Roberts, already multiple times a champion in boulder and lead climbing at World Cup level.\nHockey’s women’s quarter-finals run throughout the day.\nWorld watch\nSweden’s Mondo Duplantis keeps on setting pole vault world records. His latest was 6.24m in April this year, and you can expect him to entertain the Paris crowd while trying to better that in his final from 18:00. France’s Renaud Lavillenie will not be there to rival him – the London 2012 champion has struggled after hamstring surgery and did not hit the qualifying height of 5.82m.\nElsewhere on the track, the first round of the men’s 400m hurdles (09:05) is a chance to see Norway’s Karsten Warholm, the Tokyo champion, and biggest rivals Rai Benjamin of the US, who has the better form coming into Paris, and Brazil’s Alison dos Santos.\n3x3 basketball reaches a climax with the women’s final at 21:05 and the men’s final at 21:35. The US won the women’s title in Tokyo, while Latvia are the defending men’s champions.\nBadminton concludes with the women’s singles final at 09:55 and men’s singles final at 14:40. Denmark’s Viktor Axelsen was the only European to win an Olympic badminton title in Tokyo three years ago and could go all the way again in Paris. South Korea’s An Se-young and China’s Chen Yufei are among the favourites for women’s gold.\nFootball’s men’s semi-finals take place at 17:00 and 20:00.\nExpert knowledge\nArtistic swimming, formerly known as synchronised swimming, begins at 18:30 with the team technical routine. This is one of the few instances in which a major change to a sport will result in precisely nothing different for anyone watching.\nA rule change allowed men to take part in the team event for the first time in Olympic history, but – perhaps partly because the change took place only 18 months ago – no men actually qualified, so this will still be an all-female event. “This should have been a landmark moment for the sport,” governing body World Aquatics said, promising to work harder to help male athletes succeed.\nForty-five-year-old Bill May was the only male artistic swimmer with a realistic chance of selection, but the US left him out of their team. Before that, May had said no men at the Games would represent “a slap in the face”. US selectors said they had to pick the strongest line-up.\nSurprising moments in Olympic history\nWorld Athletics to become first federation to award prize money at Olympic Games\nGold medal events:\nAthletics (women's hammer throw, men's long jump, men's 1500m, women's 3000m steeplechase, women's 200m), boxing (women's 60kg), diving (women's 10m platform), equestrian (jumping individual), sailing (men's and women's dinghy), skateboard (women's park), track cycling (men's team sprint), wrestling (men's Greco-Roman 60kg, men's Greco-Roman 130kg, women's freestyle 68kg).\nHighlights\nThe women’s 200m final (20:40) could be stacked with US talent. The three Americans named for this event are the three fastest women in the world over this distance in 2024: Gabby Thomas, McKenzie Long and Brittany Brown. GB’s Dina Asher-Smith was the world champion in 2019 and a world bronze medallist in 2022. Jamaica’s Elaine Thompson-Herah, the Tokyo champion, has withdrawn from Paris 2024 through injury.\nThe men’s 1500m is likely to star Norway’s Jakob Ingebrigtsen, who broke the European record earlier this month. His main obstacle? GB’s Josh Kerr. We have not seen Kerr over 1500m this season but he is the world champion and declared himself on Instagram to be “working in the shadows, getting ready for the spotlights”. The final takes place at 19:50.\nIn skateboarding, it is the women’s park final at 16:30. Sky Brown was 13 when she won Olympic bronze for GB in Tokyo and now, aged 16, she is back on the team. Not only that, she enters the Games having won last year’s world title.\nBen Maher and Explosion W won a six-way jump-off to take Tokyo individual jumping gold, completing back-to-back GB victories after Nick Skelton won the same event (also in a six-way jump-off) in 2016. This time, Maher is back for GB on Point Break. Watch out for Swedish duo Henrik von Eckermann and Peder Fredricson. Fredricson has had the heartbreak of being second to the Brits in the jump-off in both Rio and Tokyo. The final starts at 09:00.\nBrit watch\nWomen’s team pursuit qualifying begins in the velodrome at 16:30. Germany set a world record to defeat GB in Tokyo’s final. Since then, GB have gone through a rebuild and made their way back up the world podium to become world champions last year. However, Katie Archibald is out of the Games after breaking her leg in a freak garden accident, so it remains to be seen how her team-mates regroup.\nSailing has scrapped its Finn class, which is unfortunate from a British perspective given GB had won it the past six times. That means attention turns to Micky Beckett in the single-handed dinghy (the ILCA 7, which you might also know as the Laser), which has its medal races on Tuesday. Beckett was a world silver medallist last year and has since racked up major wins like the Princess Sofia Regatta.\nOn the women’s side of that class, GB’s Hannah Snellgrove is competing after what she characterises as a 15-year battle for selection, during which she earned money as a local journalist and part of a folk music act to keep her sailing career going.\nWorld watch\nIreland’s Kellie Harrington will hope to successfully defend her Tokyo 2020 lightweight boxing title (final at 22:06). Harrington went years without defeat before losing at the European Championships in April.\nAmy Broadhurst, who switched to Britain after missing out on selection for Ireland, narrowly failed to make the GB team. But Harrington may have to contend with France’s Estelle Mossely, who won the Olympic title before her in Rio then turned pro. Mossely, who has won 11 and drawn one of her 12 professional fights, returned to amateur status and made the French team in the lightweight category.\nChina have won every women’s 10m platform diving event at the Olympics since 2008. The past two times, they took the silver medal as well. Gold and silver have gone to China at each of the past four world championships, too. That means GB’s Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix, who took world bronze this year, has a job on to get any further up the podium – but it’s not impossible. The final is from 14:00.\nWomen’s football semi-finals take place at 17:00 and 20:00.\nIn hockey, the men’s semis are at 13:00 and 18:00.\nWrestling’s first Paris 2024 medals are awarded, bringing with them a chance to watch some history. In the men’s Greco-Roman 130kg final (19:30), Cuba’s Mijain Lopez – if gets there – could become the first person to win the same individual Olympic event five times in a row, two weeks before his 42nd birthday.\nExpert knowledge\nIt’s OK to take some time to adjust if you’re a British track cycling fan. Paris 2024 will be the first time since 1996 that the GB line-up for an Olympics has not included one or both of Sir Chris Hoy and Sir Jason Kenny. In that time, GB won the men's team sprint three times in a row from 2008 to 2016, but the Dutch knocked the British off that perch in 2021. Watch the event from 17:59.\n(What’s that, you really need Chris Hoy and Jason Kenny to be there? Fine – Kenny is now the GB sprint coach, so he will still be in the velodrome, while Hoy is part of the BBC’s coverage team.)\nHead here for the day-by-day guide from 7-11 August"

        "content": "George Russell (right) was introduced as race winner during the podium ceremony, with his disqualification not confirmed until 17:55 BST\nLewis Hamilton inherited victory in the Belgian Grand Prix after Mercedes team-mate George Russell was disqualified two and a half hours after taking an unlikely win on the track.\nRussell pulled off an unusual one-stop strategy and held off Hamilton’s attack in the closing laps.\nBut after the race his car was found to be 1.5kg underweight, with his team admitting to \"a genuine error\". \nThat saw Hamilton promoted to a victory that had looked likely for much of the race - after he took the lead from Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc on the second lap.\nOscar Piastri is moved up to second, with Leclerc third and Max Verstappen fourth.\nRussell's car was initially weighed at 798kg, which is exactly on the minimum weight limit for car and driver combined.\nBut stewards found the car had not been fully drained of fuel and when it was, its weight was just 796.5kg.\nMercedes boss Toto Wolff said: “We have to take our disqualification on the chin.\n\"We have clearly made a mistake and need to ensure that we learn from it. To lose a one-two finish is frustrating and we can only apologise to George who drove such a strong race.\n\"Lewis was the fastest guy on the two-stop strategy and is a deserving winner.\"\nRussell pips Hamilton for stunning Mercedes one-two - Belgian Grand Prix radio & text\nRussell had appeared to have pulled off a remarkable victory from sixth on the grid, calling the strategy himself from the car, fending off a seven-time champion on tyres that were 15 laps fresher for five laps at the end off the race.\nHamilton was closing in at nearly a second a lap in the final laps but, as so many other drivers found, overtaking was harder than expected and he could never quite get close enough to challenge.\nAs Russell battled to hold off Hamilton in the final two or three laps, McLaren’s Piastri closed in on the Mercedes to set up a grandstand finish, and the three cars crossed the line nose to tail.\nSeven seconds behind them, Ferrari’s Leclerc - who had been passed by Piastri with nine laps to go around the outside of the Les Combes chicane, spent the closing laps fending off Red Bull’s Verstappen and the second McLaren of Lando Norris.\nThe three spent the final four laps nose to tail but Leclerc managed to hold his rivals at bay.\nBehind Norris, Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz passed Red Bull’s Sergio Perez with five laps to go to raise further questions about Perez’s future.\nRed Bull are expected to make a decision as to whether to drop him for the rest of the season over the forthcoming summer break - just two months after the Mexican signed a new two-year contract.\nAnd dropping from second on the grid to finish at the back of the top four teams will have done Perez no favours.\nRussell's disqualification means Hamilton is the first driver other than Max Verstappen to win two races this season\nNo-one predicted a Mercedes victory at the start of a race that many in F1 expected to devolve into a fight between the McLaren drivers and Verstappen, even though Norris and Piastri started fourth and fifth and Verstappen 11th.\nBut Hamilton moved into second place past Perez on the opening lap and followed Leclerc through the first stint.\nAn early pit stop on lap 11 put Hamilton into the lead by undercutting his rivals - stopping before them and gaining time on fresher tyres - and he held it until his second pit stop.\nRussell stopped for his set of hard tyres one lap before Hamilton, and at that stage was expecting to run a two-stop like everyone else.\nBut he found that degradation was much less than expected and, as the time of his second pit stop closed in, he said to the team to consider going to the end.\nAs he pushed on, Russell became more and more convinced of his decision, and he and the team committed.\nIt appeared initially as if Hamilton would catch and pass Russell, as he closed in quickly on his team-mate.\nBut overtaking proved to be harder than many expected and Russell was able to keep his place, up the main overtaking zone from the first corner through Eau Rouge and up the Kemmel straight to Les Combes, and he whooped with delight as he took the line - only to later be stripped of victory.\n“The tyre whisperer,” impressed team boss Wolff had said to him over the radio.\nBefore news of his disqualification, Russell said: “We definitely didn’t predict this but the car was feeling awesome, the tyres were feeling great and I kept saying: ‘We can do the one stop.’\nHamilton said: “We had such a disaster on Friday, the car was nowhere. We made some changes, it was hard to know what it would be like in the wet yesterday, and the car was fantastic today.\n“George did a great job going long on the tyres, every stint I had tyres left but the team pulled me in.”\nPiastri is fourth in the overall standings\nPiastri said he believed the McLaren did not quite have the expected pace, but he didn’t help himself by overshooting his marks at his final pit stop and costing himself a couple of seconds.\nHad he not done that, he would have passed Leclerc earlier with fresher tyres and been able to close sooner on the Mercedes, although passing proved difficult all day so it is a moot point whether he would have been able to pass either to win.\nBehind, Leclerc drove well in the unfenced Ferrari to fend off Verstappen and Norris in the closing laps.\nVerstappen had been predicted by teams’ strategy models to come through and win the race but he found progress harder than he might have expected.\nNorris, meanwhile, lost out on the first lap when he was forced a little wide at the first corner, got onto the gravel and dropped to seventh.\nNot able to pass Sainz in front of him in the first stint, he was left with too much ground to make up to join the lead battle.\n“Track position is king,” Piastri had said as he had some free air at the front between Hamilton’s final stop and his own, and that was the story of the race.\nFernando also executed a one-stop strategy to beat Alpine’s Esteban Ocon, while Daniel Ricciardo claimed the final point when Russell was disqualified."

You also need skill to go with that. Obviously it was a pretty slow wicket but we showed that we had an attack that could expose different options. \n\"Whether it was when it was reversing, when it was swinging or when it was very flat, we had an attack that could try and change the momentum of the game.\n\"Having different types of options in your armoury in a bowling attack is obviously key, especially when it's flat, when it's not really offering you much in the air or off the wicket.\" \nThis video can not be played\nSmith falls agonisingly short of a century\nMcCullum has been particularly impressed with two players who made their Test debuts during the series.\nWicketkeeper Jamie Smith finished with 14 catches and made 207 runs in four innings at an average of 51.75 having been given the nod over Surrey team-mate Ben Foakes and an out-of-form Jonny Bairstow.\nThe 24-year-old made an impressive 95 in the first innings at Edgbaston which helped England rebuild from a perilous position at 54-5. \nMcCullum said Smith's ability to do \"unselfish things\" when batting with the tail stood out. \n\"When you’re in that position at seven and wicketkeeper you're like the drummer in the band,\" the Kiwi explained. \n\"You need to be prepared to take risks and he's happy to do that, and he backs himself that he's got the power game when the field is out.\n\"No [criticism of] guys that have been before, they've done great jobs for us, but we identified that it was an area where we wanted to add a little bit more punch.\"\nStokes said Smith was \"incredibly tidy behind the stumps\" but \"without really being noticeable\".\n\"He's come in and done exactly what we've seen in him as a batter, in terms of the role batting down at number seven,\" Stokes added. \n\"The two big innings were a great sign of him understanding that role without really having any experience doing it.

He’s got inner confidence and a real confidence in his ability and skills,\" McCullum said.\n\"He's moved the ball off the seam both ways, hits great lengths, bowled high pace and committed to the bouncer plan and done what the captain asked and sustained it.\n\"He's been outstanding and he's quite cheeky within the group too and the guys love him.\"\nStokes added: \"Having Mark Wood and Gus in this game in particular I think was very good and obviously having those two operate together is very, very exciting for the future of England.\"\nThis video can not be played\nWood rips through West Indies tail\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone"

He should not be allowed to play.\"\nHowever, one Dutch fan said it was \"right\" Van de Velde was competing, adding: \"He's been punished and now it's over and he can continue with his life like anyone else.\"\nHis playing partner Immers, speaking after the match, also said he thought it was right that Van de Velde could compete.\n\"We talked about it one time and we want to enjoy every moment on this stage because we gave everything together for the past three years to qualify,\" he said.\n\"Steven is a really nice guy and for me, I played two years with him, there was nothing and now there is some people that don't like it because it is a big tournament.\"\nVan de Velde is not staying in the Olympic village and will not do any post-match media.\nThere was extra security around him when he arrived in Paris with the rest of the team.\nIn previous interviews with Dutch media, Van de Velde said: \"I can't reverse it, so I will have to bear the consequences. It has been the biggest mistake of my life.\"\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said the selection of athletes for the Games was the responsibility of individual committees.\nVan de Velde returned to playing in 2017. The Dutch Olympic Committee (NOC) said he had met guidelines set by the Dutch Volleyball Federation (NeVoBo) for athletes to resume competing after conviction.\nThe NOC said Van de Velde had returned to the playing arena \"following a specialist treatment programme\".\nIt added: \"Van de Velde has fully engaged with all requirements and has met all the stringent risk assessment thresholds, checks and due diligence. Experts have stated that there is no risk of recidivism.\n\"Van de Velde has consistently remained transparent about the case which he refers to as the most significant misstep of his life. He deeply regrets the consequences of his actions for those involved.\"\nIn a statement to BBC Sport, it also said: \"After his release, Van de Velde sought and received professional counselling. He demonstrated to those around him - privately and professionally - self-insight and reflection.\"\nMark Adams, spokesperson for the IOC, was asked on Saturday if the organisation was \"comfortable\" with Van de Velde's inclusion.\n\"To characterise it as comfortable and happy would not be correct,\" Adams said.\n\"We feel the NOC have explained their decision. \n\"Comfortable and happy, characterise it how you want, but the statement that they have given to us is correct and we will continue with the situation as it is.\"\nBBC Sports News Correspondent Laura Scott at the Eiffel Tower Stadium\nRarely does an athlete's selection for the Olympics or presence at a Games draw as much controversy as that of Van de Velde. \nIt has made a lot of people uncomfortable, but ultimately he is here because the NOC picked him and the International Olympic Committee - despite pressure including from safeguarding campaign groups - said the nomination of athletes was the sole responsibility of the respective NOCs.\nOn the way in, I stopped several fans to ask them for their views. \nSome were not aware of the story, but we spoke to fans from Germany, the UK and Ireland who felt very strongly that he shouldn't be here and said they wouldn't be supporting him.\nIt was interesting that every Dutch fan I spoke to was either unwilling to talk about the subject or was supportive of Van de Velde.\nToday's Olympics guide\nFull Paris Olympics schedule\nBBC's Paris Olympics TV schedule"

I know bowling at 93mph is tough but when it is reverse swinging as well it's going to be even tougher,\" Stokes said.\nThere were eyebrows raised when Wood was handed a three-year central contract by the England & Wales Cricket Board last November, a couple of months shy of his 34th birthday.\nHe was only two players to be given deals of that length – the other was Brook – but on this evidence it looks a smart call despite his advancing years.\nWood is bowling as quickly, aggressively and smartly as ever. A promise to break the 100mph could well come later in the summer when Sri Lanka visit for three Tests.\nThe fitness problems which plagued Wood earlier in his career, and deprived England of this type of menacing spell, also appear a thing of the past. Everything is clicking.\nAs a teetotaller he might not welcome the analogy, but like a fine wine Wood appears to be getting better with age.\nThis video can not be played\nBen Stokes hits England's fastest 50 in Test cricket\nWhen Stokes strode out to bat, chest puffed out, with a sense of purpose in his gait Edgbaston chattered that something special might be in the offing.\nHowever, this was Bazball on steroids from Stokes.\nHe shattered a 42-year record held by Ian Botham for the quickest half-century, surfing the wave of momentum generated by Wood’s spell.\nAny sense of conventional cricketing logic that an opener’s job is to diligently see the shine of the new ball, regardless of the circumstances, were laughed off by Stokes.\n\"When one hit the middle I thought 'I may as well have a crack',\" Stokes asserted, in a rather matter-of-fact manner.\nThere were some fantastic shots in this act of wanton aggression. He started with two off the first over from Alzarri Joseph, thrashing a four through the covers then neatly clipping the next ball off his leg.\nThe standout, though, was a brutal pull off Shamar Joseph that cleared the mid-wicket boundary to break legendary all-rounder Botham's record.\nHis knock helped England to their joint-fastest 50 in a Test innings, equalling the record Stokes side set in the previous Test at Trent Bridge - 4.2 overs.\nThe previous record, 4.3 overs, was set by England against South Africa at The Oval in 1994.\nInevitably, Stokes wrapped up the win with another maximum - whipping opposite number Kraigg Brathwaite over square leg.\nThis all comes with the caveat of occurring against a West Indies side browbeaten by England across the first two Tests of this series. \nThe pressure was completely off Stokes after his bowlers, with Gus Atkinson also impressing as he finished England's top wicket-taker across the three Tests with 22 victims to be named player of the series, taking the initiative.\nThere were moments in this Test - not least when they failed to review a Joe Root lbw on day two which would have been out - that did not go their way.\nIt was their batting which stumbled throughout the series, but a reflection of what it was: inexperienced, undercooked and deprived off its best players who are off playing franchise cricket.\nThis video can not be played\nAnderson advice proved the spark to wicket haul - Wood\nEngland bowler and player of the match Mark Wood: \"I was in a bit of a bad fettle actually at lunch and I was wondering if it was something I was doing wrong or if I wasn't quite getting the right length.\n\"I had a great conversation with Jimmy [Anderson], and a couple of the other backroom staff, and he just said, rather than thinking about the outcome, to start thinking about the skill element.\n\"That first wicket gave me a lot of confidence and I was able to push on from there.\"\nWest Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite: \"It was a tough series.

Now the world sees it, they've got to respect it.\"\nEdwards, who suffered his first defeat since losing to Kamaru Usman in 2015, then suggested he would like to return to action before the end of the year.\n\"One more this year, November or December I'm ready to go,\" he said.\nMMA schedule and results 2024"

Table\nAlice Capsey hit a half century as Oval Invincibles beat Welsh Fire by six wickets in The Hundred women's competition at Sophia Gardens.\nThe 19-year-old England batter passed 50 for a second successive match as Invincibles comfortably chased down a target of 117.\nHaving decided to bat, Fire lost captain Tammy Beaumont and Hayley Matthews early on, but Sophia Dunkley (35) combined with Sarah Bryce to reach 54-2 at halfway.\nDunkley fell to Amanda-Jade Wellington, while Ryana MacDonald-Gay accounted for Bryce and Georgia Elwiss as Fire finished on 116-5.\nInvincibles lost captain Lauren Winfield-Hill within two balls of their reply, caught by opposite number Beaumont, bringing Capsey to the crease.\nShe steadily accumulated runs, surviving being given out lbw to Jess Jonassen after replays showed a feather edge off the bat, and reached her 50 from 42 balls.\nOnly a spectacular catch from Matthews removed Capsey, with the West Indian all-rounder managing to avoid the boundary rope in her effort to grab a drive that looked set to be six.\nLaura Harris was then dismissed within two balls, but South African Marizanne Kapp took charge, hitting consecutive fours off Jonassen to close out the win with 12 balls to spare.\nCapsey hit 52 from 40 balls against Birmingham Phoenix in the opening match of the competition and now has 111 runs from two matches.\nSeamer Shabnim Ismail only managed to bowl 10 balls for the home side before limping off the field. The South African star was the joint second-highest wicket taker in last year's competition with 11 scalps.\nThe performance of spinner Georgia Davis will offer a crumb of comfort for Fire. The 25-year-old had Paige Scholfield caught by the sub fielder before returning to remove Capsey and Harris within the space of three balls.\nInvincibles batter Alice Capsey: \"They were bowling really well, it was for me and Kappy to build a partnership and we knew the longer we stayed in the easier it would get.\n\"I think the key is I've had a few breaks, I've prioritised what gets the best out of me.

That was the only team we haven't beaten. It was a really good test of where we're at.\n\"I do a lot of homework with the analysts and coaches. It's a starting point, I like to be fluid.

        "content": "Summer signing Leny Yoro was playing in just his second game for Manchester United\nStriker Rasmus Hojlund and £52m new signing Leny Yoro both suffered first-half injuries as Manchester United lost their opening US tour game against Premier League rivals Arsenal 2-1 in Los Angeles.\nHojlund had given his side a 10th-minute lead when he burst onto Marcus Rashford’s first-time pass, outmuscled young defender Ayden Heaven, then beat keeper Karl Hein with a shot through his legs.\nThe Dane turned a low Aaron Wan-Bissaka cross wide from close range before seeming to experience a muscle injury after 15 minutes that meant he could not continue.\nYoro’s exit was equally innocuous. The 18-year-old defender, who only joined United from Lille 10 days ago, went down and needed lengthy treatment, before he too called it a day.\nGiven the huge number of injuries that wrecked last season for manager Erik ten Hag, to lose two senior players in such a manner fewer than three weeks before United open their new Premier League campaign against Fulham at Old Trafford on 16 August is not ideal.\n\"We have to wait 24 hours and then we will hopefully know more,\" Ten Hag told MUTV. \n\"We were very careful, especially with Leny. It is disappointing he had to come off but let's be positive and see what comes out.\"\nDespite the bright start, the result was not to the Dutchman’s satisfaction either.\nGabriel Jesus levelled with a close range finish after 25 minutes, which Ten Hag was certain should have been disallowed for offside, before substitute Gabriel Martinelli cut inside 17-year-old rookie full-back James Scanlon to score the winner.\nUnited did triumph in a pre-arranged penalty shoot-out that followed, with Jadon Sancho scoring the decisive spot-kick to seal a 4-3 win.\nTen Hag made the demands being placed on players this season a theme of his pre-match news conference, stating the campaign itself would be a \"survival of the fittest\" and that \"it will happen\" when talking of injuries.\nThe reality must have exceeded his worst fears as first Hojlund, then Yoro went down of their own accord.\nHojlund appeared to feel his groin before making his way straight down the tunnel. Yoro took the longer route after lengthy treatment but was walking exceptionally slowly and seemed to be in a lot of discomfort.\nVictor Lindelof had also been ruled out with an injury 'niggle', so 20-year-old Rhys Bennett, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Stockport, took over as Harry Maguire’s defensive partner.\nIf injuries were the negative, the positive from the performance for Ten Hag was the performance of midfielder Mason Mount.\nThe former Chelsea man was one of the players who spent as much time on the treatment table as the pitch last season but in front of over 60,000 spectators, Mount probed in the manner of old and looked a genuine threat at times.\nThis video can not be played\nArsenal 2-1 Manchester United: Arteta says Jesus has point to prove\nAs was the case against Bournemouth four days ago, Emile Smith-Rowe was left out of the Arsenal matchday squad as negotiations continue over a proposed move to Fulham.\nRiccardo Calafiori is expected to be confirmed as a new signing in the next 48 hours and with the likes of England duo Declan Rice and Bukayo Saka to join up once they return to London, Arsenal will eventually look a lot different to how they did here.\nYet, in patches, they showed a fluidity in possession their opponents could not match.\nMuch to his manager’s frustration, one move came to an abrupt end when skipper Martin Odegaard appeared to be taken out by Bennett without a free-kick being awarded.\nJesus looked particularly lively for Arsenal and Martinelli, who has only just returned following Copa America duty with Brazil, was a threat from the moment he came on, with 19 minutes left.\nBy that time Jonny Evans was the only experienced player in United’s defence and the Brazilian took advantage to win the game.\n\"One training session and he comes in and plays at that level,\" said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta. \"That's the mentality of the team and individuals.\n\"Gabriel looks really sharp. He has changed a lot of things over the summer. You can see. The way he looks, his rhythm, his sharpness. \n\"You can see it in his eyes. There's some spark there. Now he has a point to prove and that is good.\"\nThe game was played on a grass pitch grown especially for the game and will be taken out on Monday to prepare the stadium for other events due to be held.\nWhile stadium officials said the move was cost effective, when asked about the environmental impact, they said attempts to find another party to take the pitch had so far proved unsuccessful.\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\nWhich Premier League clubs fly the most in pre-season?\nLatest Man Utd news, analysis and fan views\nGet Arsenal news sent straight to your phone"

        "content": "Aidan Forker followed in his manager Kieran McGeeney's footsteps by captaining Armagh to All-Ireland glory\nArmagh claimed just the second All-Ireland Football title in the county's history with a 1-11 to 0-13 victory over Galway in a nail-biting decider at a raucous Croke Park.\nLevel at 0-6 apiece at half-time, full-back Aaron McKay's 46th-minute goal proved crucial as Armagh capitalised on Galway's wayward shooting to finish strongly and capture Gaelic football's most coveted piece of silverware. \nArmagh went three points up late on, and while Galway clawed two of them back, they squandered opportunities to force extra-time as the Tribesmen fell at the last hurdle for the second time in three years after losing the 2022 final to Kerry. \nBut while Galway - who last triumphed in 2001 - fell to their knees in devastation, there was an almighty outpouring of joy from Armagh as Kieran McGeeney's players joined the heroes of 2002 as the only All-Ireland winners the county has produced. \nMcGeeney captained that 2002 team and has achieved a rare double by leading the class of 2024 to an All-Ireland title that looked most unlikely after they lost this year's Ulster final to Donegal on penalties. \nThat was Armagh's fourth penalty shootout defeat in the past three seasons. While that would be enough to break some teams, the Orchard men have used that pain to fuel a run to a second All-Ireland triumph. \nArmagh win All-Ireland for first time in 22 years - as it happened\nAaron McKay scored Armagh's goal after 46 minutes when he palmed home Stefan Campbell's ball \nWhen these sides last met in Croke Park in the 2022 quarter-finals, it was a game that sent shockwaves through the GAA, for both its nerve-shredding drama and the unsavoury scenes that broke out at the end of normal time. \nGalway eventually won that one on penalties, and while Sunday's first half lacked that encounter's thrills, it proved another tightly-contested affair with Armagh's ability to subdue Galway's heavy hitters in attack a key takeaway from the opening 35 minutes. \nPrior to throw-in, Galway lost captain Sean Kelly to injury, and while Shane Walsh and Damien Comer were both fit enough to start, they were frustrated by the Ulster county's disciplined and diligent defensive unit.\nIndeed, neither Comer or Walsh scored in the opening 35 minutes with Walsh missing two presentable frees. And with the always-impressive Rob Finnerty succumbing to injury after just 10 minutes - having already clipped over a free - Galway boss Padraic Joyce cut a troubled figure on the sideline. \nLuckily for the Connacht champions, Paul Conroy brought his shooting boots, the wily midfielder firing over two fine points with his midfield partner Cein D'Arcy - who came in for Kelly - also chipping in with an effort from play. \nD'Arcy's score ended a 13-minute scoreless period for Galway after having scored three of the game's first four points inside six minutes. \nBut after scoring Armagh's opener, Oisin Conaty scored their second before Ben Crealey knocked over the first of his two first-half points. \nExcellent efforts from Orchard skipper Aidan Forker and Barry McCambridge - one of Armagh's breakout stars from this year - also kept the Orchard men's scoreboard ticking over.\nHowever, like Walsh, Conor Turbitt was guilty of missing a straightforward free with Joe McElroy also unable to convert a mark after being found by Rian O'Neill who, for the most part, was expertly shadowed by Liam Silke. \nShane Walsh scored 0-9 in the 2022 final but endured a difficult afternoon this time around \nHaving failed to catch fire in the first half, Galway showed renewed purpose after the restart with the excellent Conroy notching his third before Cillian McDaid put Galway 0-8 to 0-6 up. \nArmagh quickly reeled Galway in through Conaty and Rian O'Neill, and while Walsh finally opened his account with an expert left-footed strike on the turn, Tiernan Kelly's immediate reply added to the Connacht side's frustrations. \nThe critical moment arrived 10 minutes into the second half. Seconds after Walsh nailed a free to put Galway 0-10 to 0-9 up, McGeeney introduced Stefan Campbell and Ross McQuillan, two players who have been hugely effective off the bench throughout the championship.\nIndeed, within seconds of entering the play, Campbell surged forward on the left, spotted an unmarked McKay in front of the Galway goal and teed up the defender to palm the ball past Connor Gleeson, prompting a huge roar from the Armagh supporters.\nAfter Armagh forward Rory Grugan was forced off with injury following a lengthy stoppage, D'Arcy brought Galway back to within one before he and Walsh fired wides to raise tension in the Galway ranks. \nWalsh kicked 0-9 in the 2022 final but he looked out of sorts at times here, following up that wide by dropping a mark short into Blaine Hughes' hands. \nAnother Galway wide - from McDaid - was sandwiched between Niall Grimley and Oisin O'Neill scores, the latter a titanic effort that put Armagh three up but proved to be their last score. \nIt was ultimately enough. While D'Arcy and McDaid raised Galway hopes with scores, Walsh dropped a free short before Dylan McHugh's effort went wide after clattering the outside of the post, with Joyce's side ending the game on 13 points from 25 shots.\nIn the dying seconds, Niall Grimley's effort came back off the post before Joe McElroy's block on Conroy robbed Galway of the chance to find an equalising score in a frenetic and heart-stopping finale. \nIt paved the way for historic scenes at the full-time whistle as the Armagh players became icons of their county, completing their arc from the devastating lows of penalty trauma to Gaelic football's ultimate high.\nAmidst the euphoria, Jarly Og Burns sprinted up the steps of the Hogan Stand to embrace his father, GAA president Jarlath Burns, as an Armagh party that will go on for weeks erupted at Croke Park. \nArmagh: B Hughes; P Burns, A McKay, B McCambridge; Connaire Mackin, T Kelly, A Forker (capt); N Grimley, B Crealey; J McElroy, R O'Neill, O Conaty; R Grugan, A Murnin, C Turbitt.\nSubs: E Rafferty, G McCabe, P McGrane, C Higgins, R McQuillan, S McPartlan, J Duffy, O O'Neill, S Campbell, A Nugent, J Og Burns\nGalway: C Gleeson; J McGrath, S Fitzgerald, J Glynn; D McHugh, L Silke, S Mulkerrins; P Conroy, C D'Arcy; M Tierney, J Maher, C McDaid; R Finnerty, D Comer, S Walsh.\nSubs: C Flaherty, J Daly, E Kelly, D O'Flaherty, K Molloy, C Sweeney, S Kelly, J Heaney, L O Conghaile, T Culhane, N Daly.\nReferee: S Hurson (Tyrone)\nArmagh pose with the Sam Maguire Cup amid joyous scenes in the stands at Croke Park"

        "content": "Peter Morgan toured with the British and Irish Lions in South Africa, with the hosts winning the Test series 3-1  \nFormer Wales and British and Irish Lions player Peter Morgan has died, aged 65.\nMorgan toured South Africa with the Lions in 1980 and captained Llanelli to victory over Australia.\nHe created a sensation in his first season in senior rugby when he broke into the Wales squad as a teenager.\nAs a utility back, he played - uniquely - in every three-quarter position for both Wales and the Lions. He played for Wales five times.\nBorn in Haverfordwest on 1 January, 1959, Morgan won a Welsh youth cap at St Helen's in 1977 against a France side featuring an emerging Serge Blanco, but a broken ankle robbed him of the vice-captaincy and more caps the next season.\nAble to play at fly-half and centre, he learned from being in the same club set-up as Phil Bennett and displaced the ageing Wales and Lions centre Roy Bergiers.\nMorgan was a pacy, skillful, a fitness fanatic and a fine seven-a-side practitioner. \nIn his autobiography, former Wales and Lions wing JJ Williams wrote of Morgan: \"I can vouch for the fact that it was a pleasure to play outside him, even if I couldn't understand a word he spoke in his Pembrokeshire dialect.\"\nIn 1980, Morgan toured with the Barbarians before winning his first Five Nations cap as replacement on St David's Day, 1980 in a 17-6 victory over Scotland. \nHis full debut, at outside-half, followed against Ireland at Lansdowne Road two weeks later, when he had an uncomfortable afternoon after a charge down and try by Cieran Fitzgerald in a 21-7 defeat. \nBut by then Morgan had already done enough to earn his Lions place, at the age of 21.\nThe tour was not a success for the Lions, who lost the Test series 3-1, but won all their provincial encounters, with Morgan playing in seven games.\nThe late Carwyn James, the legendary 1971 Lions coach, said of Morgan: \"Peter was the infant of the party in years, but more gifted than most. \n\"He had to carry the utility tag. Utility players fill gaps and on the 1980 tour there were few gaps for him to fill, yet one of the severest criticisms of the management is that they neglected him.\"\nShortly afterwards, Morgan turned down a large offer to play professional rugby league for St Helens.\nHe won the last of his Wales caps against Ireland at the National Stadium in 1981, replacing Steve Fenwick. \nWales won 9-8, but Morgan was forced to retire with broken ribs after a heavy tackle by opposite number David Irwin.\nAs a schoolboy, he had stood on the tanner bank to witness Llanelli's famous win over the All Blacks at Stradey Park in 1972, which laid the foundation for his ambition to pull on the scarlet shirt.\nOne of Morgan's Llanelli highlights was the win over Australia in November 1984.\nThe touring Wallabies were the first and only Australian side to achieve a Grand Slam in the four tests against the home nations. \nThe Scarlets' triumph, on a sodden pitch, was all the more remarkable because they were shorn of their internationals, who were preparing to face Australia with Wales four days later. \nSpeaking about Morgan, the late Wales and Lions icon Phil Bennett said: \"Peter was shy but gutsy with accurate kicking out of hand; fine distribution skills and ability to cut defences to shreds. \n\"He suffered setbacks at vital stages in his career and was unlucky not to have won many more caps.\"\nPeter Morgan pictured in 1979\nMorgan represented Pembrokeshire at every level from schools to senior rugby.\nMorgan played in Llanelli's WRU Challenge Cup final victory over Cardiff in 1985, but his career was cut short by a broken leg suffered in a derby against Swansea.\nThough he returned to action after a year out, his best days had gone.\nAfter retirement Morgan entered local politics, sitting as an independent member on Pembrokeshire County Council for 16 years.\nHe served as chair and vice-chair of the authority, and also sat on the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority.\nMorgan met his wife, Helen, via his rugby career and is survived by Helen, daughters Nia and Lowri and grandchildren Seren and Dewi."

        "content": "This video can not be played\n'One of the greatest moments in French rugby' - France win gold\nSuperstar scrum-half Antoine Dupont delivered in mesmerising style as he came off the bench to lead France to their first gold of the Paris Olympics.\nDupont, a poster boy of the Games, set up a try and scored two himself to inspire the hosts to a stunning 28-7 win over Fiji in the men's rugby sevens final.\n\"It is sensational. It is unbelievable. It is a big reward for us,\" Dupont said.\n\"It is huge. We worked a lot for a lot of months and a lot of years - in some players' case - for this moment.\"\nThe match was tied 7-7 at half-time when the inspirational Dupont, who decided to skip the Six Nations to focus on the sevens, came on to the field to a huge ovation.\nWithin 21 seconds, he had scampered down the left flank and found British-born Aaron Grandidier on hand to finish off the move.\nFrom that point, France grew in confidence and never looked like being beaten.\nDupont added two more tries - including one after the final hooter - to spark jubilant scenes.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron celebrated in the stands as the players and almost 70,000 spectators sang and danced in triumph.\nThe majority of the crowd remained standing for the next hour, going through a repertoire of songs including a rousing rendition of national anthem La Marseillaise, before applauding each of the victorious home players as the gold medals were put around their necks.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron congratulates man-of-the-moment Antoine Dupont\nCometh the hour, cometh the man.\nDupont is a titan in the 15-a-side ranks, captain of his country and voted 2021 World Player of the Year.\nSo when he switched to the sevens format it was a huge story and a decision that led to forensic analysis in France.\nThe 27-year-old decided to skip the Six Nations earlier this year to prioritise his nation's bid for seven-a-side gold glory on home soil.\nAfter an initially frosty response, that decision eventually further endeared Dupont to the French public - and it has resulted in Les Bleus landing glory on the first full day of the Games.\nFrance's biggest sports newspaper, L'Equipe, lauded him across Wednesday’s front pages, before an idolising Stade de France crowd regularly chanted his name when the tournament began.\nIn the build-up to the gold medal match, you could spot fans wearing Dupont masks as they milled about outside the stadium.\nEvery time his face appeared on the big screen inside, when the players strode out and prepared during the warm-up, the level of noise went up a notch to ear-splitting levels.\nWhen Dupont darted out at the start of the second half, expectation rose.\nThen he showed why he is one of the greats. Like all generational talents, he delivered on the biggest stage.\nHe came on, took the game by the scruff of the neck, and delivered the gold medal which France craved.\nAfterwards, Dupont was asked how he coped with being hailed by some as the best player of all time after adding sevens glory to his 15s success.\n\"It is always a pleasure to hear words like that - but honestly I don't spend a lot of time thinking about that,\" he said.\n\"I am still young and have a lot of work still to do.\"\nThis video can not be played\nSouth Africa win bronze in men's rugby sevens - highlights\nAs you walked around the Stade de France before the gold medal match, the carnival atmosphere was obvious.\nHome fans in the blue, white and red of the Tricolore – many in fancy dress, comedy wigs and face paint - made merry as they counted down to the main event which they dreamed would lead to French glory.\nBut when you actually spoke to a few away from the fun, it was clear there was a sense of concern.\nFrance might not win. In fact, they probably wouldn't – so many thought.\nThat was because France were the underdogs against two-time defending champions Fiji, who had never previously lost an Olympic men's sevens game.\nSouth Africa beat Australia 26-19 to take the bronze medal, and then the test of French resolve arrived.\nThose fears of worried home supporters seemed to be justified when the Pacific Islanders threatened to spoil the party as Joseva Talacolo went over inside two minutes.\nBut belief among the French players remained.\nBefore half-time they were level thanks to Jefferson-Lee Joseph powering through the middle and diving between the posts, almost like he was competing at the Aquatics Centre over the road.\nThen Dupont arrived.\nFuelled by the energy of the crowd, and the second-half impact of their talisman, Les Bleus moved ahead when Grandidier finished off Dupont's handiwork.\nGrandidier was born in London, grew up in Bromley and learnt to play rugby in Orpington.\nWhen still a teenager, the winger decided to take advantage of his French mother's heritage and try his luck across the Channel.\n\"To be completely honest, no-one was picking me up in England - no professional academies anyway. That's what I really wanted,\" said Grandidier, now 24, who earlier this year joined French Top 14 side Pau.\nHe told BBC Sport: \"I found out France had a system that allowed you a bit more time to break out on to the scene, so I was like, 'you know what, screw it, I've got nothing to lose, this is what I want to do'.\n\"So I decided to chase it and pursue that dream.\"\nNow Grandidier and the rest of the French sevens team are living the dream, and what the hosts will hope becomes a summer gold rush is up and running.\nToday's Olympic guide\nFull Paris Olympics schedule\nBBC's Paris Olympics TV schedule"

My career isn't defined by the success I've achieved with the bronze medal,\" he said.\n\"My career is defined by the heart that I have.\"\nBBC NI at the Olympics\nWalsh knocked out of Olympics after Traore defeat\nWhen it came to his opening bout in Paris, Walsh was not only up against Traore but the raucous home support, who cheered every punch. \nWalsh edged a cagey first round - in which both fighters were reminded to engage - but Traore fed off the energy in the North Paris Arena. \nThe French fighter responded in the second and ultimately claimed the decider as the stands reverberated with noise and clamour. \nAfter the result was declared, Walsh graciously lifted his opponent's arm into the air and he was smiling in the ring as he shook the hands of the coaches and the referee.\nAnd then came the emotion.\n\"After the qualifiers I didn't really have a chance to soak it in because there was so much pressure and a lot of expectation,\" he said.\n\"Now the emotions are coming out because to qualify was so, so hard. Thailand was one of the hardest experiences of my life. \n\"Having six fights in a week, you aren't able to show your emotions.\"\nWalsh admits he doesn't know what is next for him in his boxing journey. It's still too soon, still too raw. \n\"I'm studying for my Masters degree at the minute and I'm doing a few other things. I'm enjoying competing, but I'll weigh up my options. \n\"I'm performing well, it's just a case of if I have the love of it when I was 12 or 13. At the minute I'm enjoying it, but I have to ask myself a lot of questions. \n\"I'm only 27, so I might take another two years and come back again. Who knows?\"\nWalsh held up Traore's arm after the defeat in Paris\nHis sister Michaela was there in the arena to cheer him on, and she was shadowing every move in the stands.\nHowever, a resigned shake of her head and pat on the shoulder meant she knew what was coming when the bout was over. \nWhile his long-term future was unclear, Walsh said his immediate focus was to support his sister, who fights on Friday, and the rest of the Irish team.\n\"My luck was in Tokyo, her luck will hopefully be here with the rest of the team and I'll be there supporting them.\"\nWalsh had always said that his second Olympics would be a bonus, no matter what happened in the ring. \nHis journey in Paris may be over, but there was always a bigger picture for him. \n\"I'm walking about the Olympics Village as the happiest person in the world. It's a privilege, and as long as I came here happy I don't care about the medals or the results.\n\"It's great to achieve, but in my greatest struggle there was no medal for it. \n\"No-one really sees it, but that was my greatest achievement.\"\nToday's Olympics guide\nFull Paris Olympics schedule\nBBC's Paris Olympics TV schedule"

        "content": "Newcastle fans in Australia welcome the team in a post-season friendly with Tottenham at Melbourne Cricket Ground - three days after the 2023-24 Premier League season ended\nLos Angeles or Chesterfield? San Diego or Salford?\nThe pre-season destinations of 20 Premier League clubs may be varied, but the issue remains the same - the impact of so many flights.\nHalf (10) of the clubs have flown to the United States for friendlies; three have travelled to the Far East and the rest are in Europe and the UK.\nManchester United's pre-season schedule sees them flying almost 13,000 miles to play fixtures in Norway, Scotland, and across the US. Chelsea and Spurs are also expected to fly in excess of 12,000 miles. \nIn contrast, Everton will fly the least, with just one fixture outside the UK in the Republic of Ireland.\nSeveral clubs are also playing games against neighbouring non-league clubs, which helps provide much-needed income to make the football pyramid more sustainable and boost the local economy. Southampton play Eastleigh, West Ham play Dagenham, Villa play Walsall and Palace play Crawley.\nSpurs and Newcastle also played an exhibition fixture in May - three days after the season finished - for which they both flew to Melbourne, Australia, a game Alan Shearer described as “madness”. Add in those air miles and both teams will have travelled in excess of 30,000 air miles in the close-season, equivalent to more than once around the globe, to play in non-competitive matches.\nNewcastle and Spurs both have a target to be halve emissions by 2030 and be Net Zero by 2040, while Manchester United and Chelsea are in process of establishing an emissions reduction plan. \nNet Zero requires the reduction and removal of all 'non-essential emissions' - so are these games essential?\nLeagues to sue Fifa over 'abuse of dominance'\nPremier League pre-season fixtures & results\nNewcastle v Spurs friendly in Australia 'madness'\nWycombe's David Wheeler is a leading sustainability campaigner in football and told BBC Sport: \"These games are only necessary in the sense that the clubs want to make more money and grow their fanbase\".\nHe added: \"The vast majority of players don't want to be away from their families, they don't want to be travelling around the world after a full slog of a season. They're overworked and injuries have gone through the roof, so there is a synergy between player welfare and planetary welfare.\"\nIn April, Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said the football calendar is \"getting to a tipping point\". However, the Premier League also launched its own branded 'Summer Series' of fixtures in the United States last year, which is due to return next year.\nAs part of the ongoing dispute around the global football calendar, world governing body Fifa accused some leagues of \"hypocrisy\" and \"commercial self-interest\" this week by sending their players on \"extensive\" global pre-season tours.\nIncluding the May trip to Australia for Newcastle and Tottenham more than doubles those two clubs' total flights in the close-season and puts them way above the rest of the Premier League for environmental impact.\nAn estimated travelling group of 30 flying 12,864 air miles business class generates around 200 tonnes of CO2 - the equivalent of 500,000 miles driven by an average petrol car, or the entire annual emissions for a year of 16 people in the UK. \nAlthough relatively small emissions in football's bigger picture, as clubs try to help spread a positive message on environment, experts argue that the pollution generated by these close-season fixtures undermines progress.\nDr Mark Doidge from the University of Loughborough said: \"The continued thirst of Premier Leagues clubs for a global audience has significant implications for the sustainability of football.\n\"These pre-season friendlies make it much harder for football to be seen as a leader in the fight against climate change as they are not leading by example. Too often, the focus is on fans and their CO2 emissions, rather than turning the attention on clubs and football authorities. \n\"Fans are not stupid and can spot hypocrisy a mile off. If the club is not leading by example, then they lose any moral authority to ask fans to join the fight.\"\nHarry Maguire is part of Manchester United's pre-season tour which took in Norway, Scotland and the United States\nThe Premier League regularly points out that clubs implement their own travel plans and that, for some clubs, their flights taken in a season make up less than 1% of their total emissions.\nClubs have signed up to a league-wide commitment which includes developing a robust environmental sustainability policy by the end of the 2024-25 season.\nTottenham said they are \"committed to minimising its environmental impact\" in all their operations, \"which will take time and effort\". Spurs say they ensure all teams travel \"as sustainably as possible throughout the season\". The club \"measures, manages and reports on travel emissions\" and will offset \"where possible\".\nA Premier League spokesperson said: “The Premier League recognises the need to take action on climate change and is committed to reducing its overall climate impact. In November 2021, the League joined forces with other leading sports organisations by signing up to the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework, which includes aims to achieve Net Zero emissions by 2040.\n“The Premier League is also progressing its own environmental sustainability strategy development, which will set out plans to deliver climate action. As part of this strategy, the League will continue to engage with and work alongside clubs and partners, to find practical ways of reducing football’s environmental impact. We will also encourage fans throughout the world to consider how they can contribute to this action and reduce their own carbon footprint.\n“Clubs have demonstrated their commitment to positive change in this area and continue to play an important role in raising awareness of the issue among fans, while also working on policies to improve environmental sustainability across their business operations.\"\nBBC Sport calculates the distance between fixtures using the most local airports and assuming teams would fly directly from one fixture to another unless there was a significant gap between games - in which case we factored in a return flight. \nWe use the Air Miles Calculator., external The emissions calculations are based on a travelling party of 30 flying business class on scheduled services and weighted according to UK government greenhouse gas conversions.\nSome teams have flown more air miles, but polluted less because there are different CO2 per mile calculations depending on whether the flight is domestic, short haul to or from the UK, long haul to or from the UK or an international flight between two non-UK destinations.\nThe results are an indicator of air miles and emissions only.\nBBC Sport has sent two journalists to cover selected games in the Unites States this summer, and one journalist to Everton v Sligo Rovers.\nFollow your Premier League club and get news, analysis and fan views sent direct to you"

To come away with the medal feels really, really amazing.\"\nGold for world champions Chang Yani and Chen Yiwen was rarely in doubt in an impressive performance which sealed a sixth consecutive gold for China in this event.\nAmerica's Sarah Bacon and Kassidy Cook took silver.\nLiz Ferris won Team GB's last female diving Olympic medal in 1960 \nToday's Olympic guide\nFull Paris Olympics schedule\nBBC's Paris Olympics TV schedule\nThis video can not be played\nReaction: Yasmin Harper and Scarlett Mew Jensen\nMew Jensen's injury ruled her out of diving for six weeks in the run-up to the Games and meant she would not compete in the individual competition.\n\"You have got to push doubts to the side,\" she said. \"Yas has been completely supportive.\"\nThe pair, who are staying together in the Olympic village and were sporting elaborate nail art painted by Harper with equipment she has brought to Paris, were second after the opening round of dives but slipped down the standings after small errors in their next two efforts.\nThat left them in sixth, but only nine points separated them from the bronze medal position before a strong fourth dive moved the British pair back into contention.\nHarper and Mew Jensen followed their score of 71.10 with 70.68 on their final dive, but that only gave them an advantage of 58.68 over Australian pair Anabelle Smith and Maddison Keeney – the world silver medallists.\nOn their final dive, Smith almost slipped from the board, doing well to even make it into the pool, and they scored just 48.60 to finish fifth.\n“We knew even if we did a good one we would still be on the back foot,” Mew Jensen said. “We knew Australia needed to mess up.\n“For that to actually happen, we were very, very shocked. They are very talented and experienced.”\nSmith said: \"We’re disappointed, obviously. \n\"I made a pretty big mistake, when we were in a good position to medal, but that’s diving. Sometimes you can’t control that. It’s just unlucky.”\nGreat Britain's last medal on the opening day of an Olympics was won by Peter Waterfield and Leon Taylor, who was part of the BBC commentary team in Paris.\n\"Right place, right time,\" Taylor said of the British medal.\n\"That's what happens in diving. What an incredible competition.\"\nMew Jensen and Harper had won bronze and silver medals at the World Championships in recent years but this was not one of the 63 medals Team GB are predicted to win in Paris.\nThe diving continues on Monday when Tom Daley will compete at his fifth Olympics alongside Noah Williams in the 10m synchronised event, in which they are among the favourites.\nAndrea Spendolini-Sirieix and Lois Toulson are expected to be in medal contention in the women's 10m event, while Jack Laugher and Anthony Harding are also fancied in the men's 3m springboard."

        "content": "The people v Andy Murray: Four weeks that changed him and us\nInscribed above the doors that lead to Wimbledon's Centre Court is a famous line from Rudyard Kipling's poem, If.\n\"If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster and treat those two impostors just the same,\" it reads.\nIt is there to remind the world's best and their challengers that you are defined by more than the scoreboard.\nNo-one knows that as well as Andy Murray.\nThe grass courts at SW19 were the scene of a four-week period in 2012 that changed the way a swathe of the British public thought of Murray. Beaten in the Wimbledon final, he regrouped, returned and won Olympic gold on the same court in front of packed stands. \nHe swore. He cried. He celebrated. He felt the love.\nThis is the story of the 28 days that confirmed Murray as a national treasure.\nMurray watched Jessica Ennis-Hill, Mo Farah and Greg Rutherford win athletics golds the night before his London 2012 final against Roger Federer\nBefore he was Sir Andrew Murray OBE, world number one, three-time Grand Slam champion, one of the nation's greatest-ever athletes... he was, to one woman at least, something altogether less celebratory.\nIn 2006, the football World Cup was taking place at the same time as Wimbledon. A 19-year-old Murray, himself once a promising youth footballer, joked in an interview that he would support \"whoever England were playing against\".\nIt went down like a lead balloon. He was abused in the comments of a blog he wrote on his website and even his wristbands, decorated with the Scottish saltire, attracted scrutiny. \nMurray had become a lightning rod, attracting ire in an edgy Anglo-Scottish atmosphere. The previous month, the then Scottish First Minister had been criticised for saying he would not be supporting England.\nBut the reaction to Murray's joke was on a far larger scale.\nIn the aftermath, Murray, playing only his second Wimbledon, walked past a spectator on the way to his match. He overheard her telling a friend, in expletive-laden and anti-Scottish language, that she had just spotted him.\n\"I was like, What? I was 19. This is my home tournament. Why is this happening?\" Murray remembered in a 2017 interview., external\n\"I was still a kid and I was getting things sent to my locker saying things like: 'I hope you lose every tennis match for the rest of your life.'\"\nBy the time 2012 rolled around, Murray had already broken new ground. \nHe had reached the US Open final in 2008, becoming the first British man to make a major final since Greg Rusedski in New York 11 years earlier. \nTwo further Slam final appearances followed - the Australian Open in 2010 and 2011 - but Britain was still searching for a first male major singles champion since Fred Perry in 1936.\nBut the ambivalence of some of the general public remained. \nAs the Twitter joke went, Murray was British when he won and Scottish when he lost. \nIt sometimes seemed there was something inordinate about Murray - his outspokenness was loved to a certain point, his on-court anger amusing when he was winning but derided when he was losing. \nAt this point, Murray was a nascent member of the Big Four. Roger Federer was transcendent, described as a 'god', especially at Wimbledon. Rafael Nadal had the grit, the determination, the never-say-die attitude. \nNovak Djokovic, another relative newcomer trying to upset their duopoly, defied belief, limbs bending every which way, equipped with an endurance level and mental strength few can match.\nBut Murray? Murray was the most human. A man who sometimes looked as if he actively hated the sport of tennis. No-one could ever accuse Murray of hiding his emotions. And that rubbed up some the wrong way.\nHe was accused of being whingey, of being anti-English, of being boring, when really he was doing what we all do - getting frustrated about the job and attempting to have a laugh along with it.\n\"I think it's very difficult for any young player who is thrust into the spotlight to get to grips or feel comfortable with facing and understanding the media,\" said his mum Judy, speaking on Andy Murray: Will to Win, a recent BBC Sport documentary.\n\"One of the things in tennis is that players have to face the media after every match whether they win or lose. Of course, it's a lot easier to face the media when you're winning.\n\"As an 18-year-old he'd had a little bit of media training but nothing really prepares you for suddenly being in front of a room of about 300 people. \n\"I think his reaction to anything is to be truthful and say what you're thinking. In years to come, you will become much more practised.\"\nMurray, seen here aged 13 at a high-profile junior tournament in Tarbes, has long been accustomed to the attention, hype and scrutiny of elite tennis life\nAnd so to Wimbledon. The crowds gathered on Henman Hill - in the days when shouts of \"come on, Tim!\" still raised a chuckle on Centre Court - to watch the human take on the god.\nIt was Murray's first Wimbledon final, Federer's eighth. The newspapers declared Murray a hero, talking about his date with destiny. But as one paper asked on their front page: \"Can he finish the job?\"\nJohn McEnroe, commentating on BBC TV, pointed out the quandary for the crowd. \"I'm interested to see what will happen if and when, as we expect, the crowd gets behind Murray. He should be reminding them that I have no Wimbledon wins and Federer has six - but everyone loves Roger.\"\nThe tennis was electric. Murray was excellent. Federer was better. But it was the speech that followed, made as Murray walked up to accept the runner-up trophy, that lingers in people's minds.\nMurray puffed out his cheeks as he tried to speak, before he was drowned out by the noise from the crowd. He smiled, shook his head and exhaled before, with a voice on the verge of breaking, saying: \"I'm going to try this. And it isn't going to be easy...\"\nEven now, it's hard to watch. His voice cracked throughout. There's the dry humour - Federer \"is not bad for a 30-year-old\" - and the heartfelt thanks to his team. The acknowledgement that \"I'm getting closer\", both honest and cruel to think about. But it's the bit where he thanks the crowd, the raw emotion, that really cuts through. \nHe was held up by three separate ovations before departing to another. By the end, his mother, wife-to-be and plenty of those in the stands were in tears. \n\"I felt like I was playing for the nation,\" Murray said later. \"And I couldn't quite do it.”\nIt was pure emotion. The man who had been accused of being cold, grumpy, anti-English, was standing at Wimbledon - that most quintessentially English of places - in tears, telling the crowd how much their support means to him.\n\"To watch him communicate how much that moment meant to him made me want to root for him more, no question,\" Henman said in a BBC retrospective in 2020.\n\"I find it slightly sad that it took him to cry in his acceptance speech for people to suddenly take a step back and go: 'Wow, he has got a heart. He is a sensitive soul.'\"\nThis video can not be played\nWimbledon 2012: Andy Murray's tears in defeat\nThe defeat certainly cut deep.\n\"I was unbelievably upset, disappointed and all of those things,\" says Murray looking back at that defeat by Federer.\n\"I said to myself after that I may never win a Grand Slam. I was working as hard as I could work and getting close, but it was never quite enough.\n\"But the Olympics was coming up and I had to make the most of it. I got back on the practice court and ended up having probably the most important week of my tennis career.\"\nFour weeks to the day after the Wimbledon final, at the same venue, Murray was striding out behind Federer once again. \nThis time, it was the Olympics. The weather had gone from drizzly to baking hot, the roof wide open to let the sunlight flow down on to Centre Court. \nAnd, with the All England Club's all-white dress code out the window and Britain gripped by the Games, the atmosphere was bubbling.\nWATCH: Andy Murray: Will to Win\nLISTEN: Sporting Giants - Andy Murray\nMurray to retire after Paris Olympics\n'Compelling on and off court' - a decade on tour with Murray\n\"That day was the first time I really saw the crowd really behind him,\" reflects McEnroe.\nSingles gold was the one thing missing from Federer's packed CV, and given the surface and venue, he was the favourite. \nAnd yet, in just under two hours, Murray overwhelmed him in straight sets to claim what he later described as \"the biggest win of my life\". \nIn front of a rapturous crowd, Murray became the first British man to win Olympic singles gold since Josiah Ritchie in 1908.\nThe next day, Murray shared space on the back pages with Usain Bolt and Jessica Ennis-Hill. He had watched the athletics the night before his final to inspire him. He later wrote in his autobiography that \"as an individual sportsman, I have certainly never experienced anything like it\".\n\"I think that was the making of him really,\" says Jamie Murray, Andy's older brother and seven-time Grand Slam doubles champion. \nThat year was undoubtedly a turning point. Murray went on to win his first Grand Slam at the US Open two months after the Olympics, and ended the year as the world number three. But something had also shifted for the public.\nAs one fan told the Guardian, external after his Olympic triumph: \"I didn't used to like him - he was no Tim. I started liking him when he showed some emotion after losing to Federer in the Wimbledon final. You can see how much it means to him.\" \nMurray himself reflected after his US Open win that \"it's a shame that it took me crying at Wimbledon to maybe change that a little bit, but the support I've had over the last few months has been unbelievable.''\n\"In 2012, after he won the US Open, there was an opportunity to come back to Dunblane and do an open-top bus tour,\" Judy remembered.\n\"Andy is really quite shy and under the radar, he was perhaps a little unsure about that and whether anybody would turn up or be interested.\n\"But the crowds that were trying to come into the town that day... The high street in Dunblane is a one-way street, very narrow, and we got off on the dual carriageway and walked down into the high street.\n\"The turnout of the crowds, it was canny.\"\nMurray and his wife Kim have reopened a hotel in his hometown of Dunblane, partly inspired by a desire to give back to the local community\nIt is now 12 years since that summer. Murray has played in his final Wimbledon and is approaching his final Olympics. In that time, he has won three majors, become world number one, had a metal hip inserted and become a feminist icon. He is given ovations every time he walks out at Wimbledon.\nThere are still countless tweets about Murray doing it again, the rollercoaster ride he takes us on as he scraps and rages against the dying light.\nMurray is a bone-fide national treasure, and those four weeks at Wimbledon played no small part in that.\nAs three-time finalist Andy Roddick put it: \"He deserves his moment to say goodbye at Wimbledon. He's too important to Great Britain and Wimbledon history to not have it.\"\nThis feature was initially published on 27 June 2024\nFrom 15 Wimbledon campaigns, Murray has won two singles titles.

If you have been affected by any of the issues raised, BBC Action Line can provide contacts to find help.\n\"I've got some proper Halloween scars on this one.\"\nMMA fighter Paddy 'The Baddy' Pimblett points to the marks left by three operations on his foot. He's had another three on his hands.\n\"My body is falling apart at 29 - but I've been fighting since I was 15,\" he says.\n\"I just get on with it.\"\nThe Next Generation Gym is where he gets on with it.\nPimblett and Molly 'Meatball' McCann, 34, are the two highest-profile members of a tight-knit MMA fighting community at the renowned Liverpool gym.\nIt is where both are preparing for fights in Manchester later this month; contests which could be significant to their careers after 18 months of turbulence, headlines and life changes.\nThey are part of a wider, longer-term project though.\nTheir training is led by head coaches Paul Rimmer and Ellis Hampson, who joined forces 20 years ago to build an MMA community and a lasting legacy for Liverpool.\nWATCH: Paddy & Molly: Show No Mersey\nPimblett and McCann series: injuries, weight-cuts and being proud scousers\nIn 2001, a 21-year-old Rimmer, inspired by a childhood interest in karate and Japanese wrestling programmes, took out a £6,000 loan and left his office job. He travelled across the Atlantic to the Next Generation Fighting Academy in Irvine, California, 40 miles south east of Los Angeles.\nHe trained all day, every day, for nine months under the tutelage of Chris 'The Westside Strangler' Brennan.\n\"I slept on bunk beds in the back of the gym and walked to a weights gym to take showers,\" he says.\n\"It was really hard.\"\nHe came back with a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt and a brand that he was determined to spread to Liverpool.\n\"Next Generation in Liverpool has been about putting the stuff in place that we never had here,\" he says.\n\"There was no MMA, fighting heroes or gyms to look up to. This is an alternative to to offices and football to make opportunities for kids in this city.\"\nThe gym is split across two floors in a windowless industrial building in the Fabric District, an area which holds the history of the Liverpool's rag trade. Metal shutters are peeled back to reveal an expanse of bright blue training mats and interior walls covered in graffiti art.\nThe gym's community comes from all walks of life, with under-16s training next to the likes of Pimblett and McCann.\nIn total, it is home to 15 professionals across four major MMA promotions - UFC, Bellator, Cage Warriors and Oktagon.\nTwo coaches are at the centre of it all, Hampson in full body pads while Rimmer sits on the floor watching intently and absorbing every detail.\nThe atmosphere is one of concentration and camaraderie, rather than tension or testosterone. The attention to detail you might even describe as geeky.\n\"Most of it is like a dance,\" says McCann as we sit on the mats after a training session.\n\"If you look at combat sports or martial arts, it's an art form. It's not plain sailing, it’s so hard, but for me it’s the truest form of expression.\"\nAfter back-to-back losses in November 2022 and July 2023, McCann dropped a weight division, worked hard on weaknesses in grappling and committed to \"saying less and doing more\".\n\"I grew up doing karate-type boxing, just all striking really,\" she says.\n\"I'd have a good go at grappling but it didn't set my heart on fire. And then I lost twice by arm bar and it just slaughtered me.\"\nThe work paid off. McCann made her as a strawweight in February, defeating Diana Belbita by arm bar.\n\"I also felt like it was my responsibility to give my heart and soul in interviews,\" she adds of her previous approach to MMA.\n\"But people turned on me, so I don't carry that any more. After my losses I had therapy to deal with trauma from my past and the professional stuff. I felt lighter after.\n\"So now it's 'say less, do more'. I will be better.”\nPimblett and McCann are two of the big draws at the new Co-op Live Arena in Manchester on 27 July. It will be somewhat of a homecoming; it's the first time the pair have fought on a UFC card in the North West.\nMcCann's fight style is more concise, reserved and harnessed, but her confidence is undimmed. She has promised to \"destroy\" opponent Bruna Brasil.\nCage Warriors fighter Adam Cullen also trains at Next Generation. Like McCann, the 26-year-old has experienced the unforgiving side of the MMA fanbase.\nCullen was on a seven-fight winning streak before suffering a knockout defeat in April 2023. He made a winning return in September but was on the wrong end of a split decision in March this year.\n\"It's definitely a mental strain because one minute you're the next big thing, then you lose one fight and people say you're nothing,\" he says.\n\"In the gym, you never feel alone or lost. Someone has always been through what you have. The actual fighting is what keeps you going back. You go from terrified to top of the world in seconds.\"\nCullen was inspired to train at Next Generation by Pimblett's early, pre-UFC success in MMA.\nHe turned up at the gym and soon found himself training alongside Pimblett and McCann.\nIt’s a defining characteristic of the gym. Despite its global UFC stars, there is no hierarchy. Everybody trains together regardless of external status.\nDespite five wins from five fights in the UFC, Pimblett, like McCann and Cullen, has experienced the ups and downs of life in the octagon and outside of it.\nIn July 2022, he made headlines around the world after a sensational win over American Jordan Leavitt.\nIn an emotional post-fight interview, he appealed for men to talk about their mental health, revealing a friend had recently died by suicide.\nSuch is Pimblett's charisma, warm-heartedness and authenticity, that Liverpool therapy centre James' Place - a suicide prevention charity focused on men - reported a surge in enquiries following his speech.\n\"In this city, you hear it all the time about people killing themselves. When my friend took his own life I felt I had to say something. People praised me but I just felt I was doing my part as anyone in my position should be doing - it matters. It’s more important than fighting,\" he says.\nFast forward six months though and it wasn't praise he was hearing.\nPimblett was jeered when he was awarded a controversial decision victory over Jared Gordon in Las Vegas. Soon after, he attracted more criticism, following a dispute with MMA commentator Ariel Helwani.\n\"Everyone just proper changed on me,\" he says. \"I get on with it because it's the sport I'm in. I'm not signed in to any of my social media because I'll just start commenting back to people again.\"\nPimblett will fight Bobby 'King' Green in July but had hoped to face the higher-ranked Renato Moicano.\nHe says training is focused on building up wrestling and sparring technique.\n\"When I grapple, I always feel confident. It's my striking I have to improve.\n\"I feel like over the last fight camp or two, it's come on leaps and bounds.\"\nThe UFC main card will begin at 3am in Manchester, to tie in with American television.\nIt means the Next Generation Gym will be busy in the middle of the night for the few weeks before the fight, as Pimblett and McCann acclimatise.\nIt is also busy at home for Pimblett. In May, he became a father for the first time.

Every bolt lands in the same place: 21 July 1964.\nSixty years ago, a summer storm erupted over Middlesex and lightning struck a lone golfer.\nJohn White, 27, was found crouched and scorched under a tree, the rings on his fingers fused to the shaft of the club he was clutching.\nTottenham and Scotland had lost one of the finest footballers of his generation - a Double winner, with a European Cup Winners' Cup medal to his name - at the height of his powers.\nRob, just six months old at the time, had lost a father.\nHis search has continued ever since.\nPat Jennings (front, far right) and Jimmy Greaves (behind Jennings) attend White's funeral on 25 July 1964\nRob has spent his life trying to unravel a death and reveal its victim, listening at closed doors and investigating sliding doors.\nThe day he knows best in his father's life is the last.\nIt is one littered with chance encounters and alternate universes, any of which would have led John out of a lightning bolt's path.\nOn the fateful morning of 21 July 1964, Tottenham's players gathered for some team photos and gentle pre-season training at White Hart Lane.\nHaving finished in the top four in seven of the previous eight seasons, they were an established power, with an attack centred on Jimmy Greaves' finishing and Cliff Jones' trickery.\nJohn White's gifts were more subtle. He  had a silken first touch, an astute passing game and an ability to lose his marker that, combined with his slight frame and pale complexion, earned him the nickname 'the Ghost'.\nBill Nicholson knew John's value. Having lost Dave Mackay to a broken leg and captain Danny Blanchflower to retirement, the manager had told John that his next Tottenham team would be built around him.\nWhite (far right) in action in the 1962 FA Cup final against Burnley. His Tottenham side retained the FA Cup with a 3-1 win in front of 100,000 spectators\nThat was all to come, though. This wasn't the time of year for serious business.\nAfter training, barely blowing, John stripped down to his vest and pants to take on team-mate Terry Medwin in an indoor tennis match, rather than head straight home.\nWhen John returned to the dressing room, he was confused. His trousers were missing.  Ten minutes before, a smiling Jones had driven out of White Hart Lane, waving them out of his car window in glee at a well-executed prank.\nJohn eventually found a pair to borrow, finally returned home and, despite the day drawing on, said he was going to play golf.\nHis young wife Sandra, juggling Rob and his two-year-old sister, suggested he shouldn't. They argued.\nDelay heaped on delay. The sky darkened.\nA compromise was found. Sandra dropped John off at Crews Hill golf course. He headed into the club shop and bought a pack of three balls. As he left, he bumped into Tony Marchi, another Tottenham team-mate. Having asked about for a playing partner at training earlier in the day, John asked for a final time. Did Tony fancy playing with him?\n\"As far as we know, that was the last conversation my father had,\" says Rob.\n\"The last thing that Tony thought as he watched my dad go out was: 'John is going to get really wet out there this afternoon.'\"\nMarchi, having played his own round already, opted against joining John. The final sliding door shut. John walked out another and on to the course.\n\"I know that Tony [who died in 2022] always wished he could have just had another paragraph of conversation with my dad,\" says Rob. \"Because if he had, my dad wouldn't have been in that place at that time.\"\nThe White family in 1964, with two-year-old Mandy sitting on John's knee and a young Rob, wearing one of John's Scotland caps, being held by Sandra\nThe landlord emerges from behind a curtain, cigarette in mouth, thinning hair slicked back, and nonchalantly hands out a collection of pistols to the suited young men on the other side of the bar.\nEach handles them with awed reverence, spinning the barrels and staring down the sights.\nAt one point, one of young men, blonde and slight, takes a handkerchief out of his pocket and blows his nose.\nAnd all the time, an unseen Pathe newsreader chatters away over the top.\nIt is a film from 1962 – a different time when top-flight footballers would be little more than extras in a news report about a gun-collecting publican in north London., external\nJohn White and his team-mates played their parts well, looking on in due awe as their host spun a gun on his finger and slotting it back into his holster.\nFor Rob, the footage is part of a patchwork he has been stitching together over the past 60 years.\nThe first pieces came when, aged nine, he sneaked up into the attic of the family home and opened up a cardboard box.\n\"It was like Tutankhamun's tomb - it had scrapbooks, newspapers, programmes, boots, medals, a couple of Scotland caps, a shaving kit that smelt of Old Spice,\" Rob says.\n\"As a kid, I would sneak up into the loft and essentially grieve and get really quite sad looking at this stuff.\n\"It was as if my Dad was one of those wire mannequins that sculptors might use; I knew 'the Ghost', that my dad was something, but finding this stuff allowed me to put texture on that outline.\"\nWhite and Greaves celebrate an FA Cup final victory at Wembley\nJust as on the pitch though, tracking down John was not easy.\nRob's mother Sandra could remember driving up to the course to pick up her husband, seeing the clubhouse surrounded with police cars and then, such was the shock, little else from the next five years of her life.\nIn the wake of John's death, the sideboard trophies, celebratory photos and any trace of his existence were tidied away. In their place, a culture of stoicism, silence and secrecy dominated. His father was rarely spoken about – a subject too sore for anyone to know how to handle.\n\"Most families have a story that as a kid you don't know the full details of, but you know never to ask about,\" says Rob.\n\"Maybe you are told something once, or a door is half-open and you hear something. You can't quite piece it together, but, as humans, we create our own narrative, filling in the gaps with information that may, or may not, be right.\"\nFor Rob, there was plenty of information to fill in the gaps.\nJohn's life was documented in an uncommon depth for his era.\nPeople shared hundreds of photos, thousands of memories and the odd piece of footage.\nUsually the film was match action, but occasionally it was something rarer and, in many ways, more precious – an afternoon John spent in a pub with its eccentric landlord and a Pathe film crew for instance.\nTottenham players at their 1962 Christmas party with Tony Marchi (far left), Jimmy Greaves (centre), Dave Mackay (third from right) and John White (second from right)\nToo often, though, the character lacked depth: as thin as the page of the comic he seemed to spring from.\n\"He was this kind of Roy of the Rovers figure and as I got older I got frustrated and almost embarrassed by people having a better knowledge of my dad than I did,\" Rob says.\n\"Part of the joy of having a father is finding our own identity - there is a little blueprint there and if we are lucky we follow the good bits and jettison the bad bits - but I didn't have that.\n\"There is still a kid in me that wants to know the simple stuff: what he smelt like and sounded like, a bit more about him, rather than this persona. That is the eternal frustration.\"\nRob channelled that frustration into a book - The Ghost of White Hart Lane - interviewing family members, former team-mates, friends and acquaintances, to try and discover the man behind the myth.\nAnd gradually he found him.\nRob heard about the sadness and homesickness that would grip John each winter in London. He heard about the time he drove home dangerously drunk, clipping the White Hart Lane gates in his car. Most revealingly, an uncle told Rob about the child that John had fathered in Scotland and left behind before he travelled south, played for Spurs and met Sandra.\n\"Part of me has always been trying to live up to this person who was absolutely perfect, who was idolised not just by the family, but by hundreds of thousands of people,\" says Rob.\n\"To find out he had defects and weaknesses, that he struggled with confidence, mental health and seasonal affective disorder, that he had made mistakes - if I had found all that out earlier, it would have made more sense to my life.\n\"If we know our parents are fallible, it really makes us understand that we can make mistakes. We don't have to know all the answers.\"\nJohn's absence shaped Rob as surely as his presence would have.\nRob is a still-life photographer - \"I have always been looking for those details and clues\" - and is also training as a counsellor.\nLater this month, Rob will be in the audience at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for the first performance of a play, called The Ghost of White Hart Lane, that he commissioned about his father's life. \nThe staging is intended to share his father's story to several generations of fans who remember neither John's life or death. \n\"It is something I talk about with my own therapist,\" he says. \"Having seen life breathed into the story at the play's read-throughs, it reinforced the reasons I wanted to get involved with the project.\n\"I think there is something of trying to bring my dad back to life.\"\nAfter two nights in Tottenham, the play will then transfer north, taking the opposite journey to the one John took in life, for a stint at the Edinburgh Festival., external\nThere are some things that remain lost. Rob is still searching for a recording of John's voice.

        "content": "Fuelling the Tour de France: Secrets of the team kitchens\nA few weeks prior to a previous Tour de France, amid the maelstrom of planning involved with eight riders and more than a dozen support vehicles navigating the country, EF Education-EasyPost head performance chef Owen Blandy received notice of an issue at one of the hotels.\nFor reasons unexplained, Blandy was told he would not be allowed to use the hotel kitchen, nor even cook in his own food truck on site.\nIf he desired, he might be able to supervise the hotel's own chef in their preparations, but would not be permitted to do so from inside the kitchen.\nFor a man tasked with fuelling a professional cycling team throughout the most important race on the sport's calendar, it was not ideal news. But he was entirely unflustered.\n\"It was fine,\" shrugs Blandy. \"I just had a challenging few days before settling into my own kitchen.\"\nPersonal experience gleaned from a cumulative total of more than a year on the road at major races has taught Blandy to roll with the punches.\n\"There are never perfect working conditions in cycling so you always have to adapt and be flexible,\" he says.\nIf a hotel bans the team chef from cooking food, then so be it.\nPrimoz Roglic chalked up seven top-three finishes in Grand Tours for Visma-Lease a Bike before switching to Bora-Hansgrohe this year\nNot so long ago, the professional cycling world's approach to fuelling was remarkably basic.\nOptions for riders barely extended beyond a monotonous menu of pasta, rice or whatever fare that night's hotel kitchen decided to serve up.\nThese days, it is an entirely different prospect, with vast sums spent on custom-built food trucks, personalised nutrition apps and meticulously planned meal regimes all in the name of performance enhancement.\nFor the nutritionists and chefs tasked with providing sustenance to power their team's riders over 2,170 miles in the coming weeks there are principally two dilemmas: what food to prepare and how to do so in an ever-changing environment.\nThe answers are gleaned from a year-round process that begins in December during pre-season training.\nWhile the riders are honing their bodies, ready for the multitude of races ahead, the number-crunchers eagerly gather data to better understand their nutritional needs.\n\"We know their individual bodies, their metabolism, how many calories they burn when resting and exactly what they will do in training, the intensity, how long and how many calories they will burn,\" says Visma-Lease a Bike head of nutrition Martijn Redegeld.\n\"Heart rate plays a role. We have that after each training ride. And at certain points in the season we test lactate measurements and breathing measurements in the lab to develop a good profile of each rider.\"\nAs one of three teams - alongside UAE Team Emirates and Ineos Grenadiers - whose budget tends to dwarf all others, Visma-Lease a Bike has strived to place itself at the forefront of nutritional advancement.\nPartnerships with universities aim to ensure they are firmly aware of developments within the field \"to keep that competitive edge over other teams\", says Redegeld.\nWith riders burning an average of 6,000 calories per day during the Tour (around three times more than a resting adult), Visma-Lease a Bike have even begun using artificial intelligence to help determine precisely how much - and what type of - food each individual cyclist should consume.\nPersonalisation has become increasingly paramount, with the team developing its own app,, external where various algorithms are used to generate individualised nutrition plans.\nWhen a rider comes back from a day on the bike, they simply open the app and are told exactly how many grams of each nutritional component (carbohydrates, proteins, fats etc) to put on their plate. No brain power is wasted beyond using the ubiquitous buffet table weighing scales.\nWhile the methods used to generate precise nutritional needs vary between teams, all of them work to a broad five-meal daily plan of breakfast, pre-race snack, on-bike fuelling, recovery meal and dinner.\nThe core feeding principles remain the same across the peloton, although they are tweaked depending on the upcoming day's requirements and whether the rider in question is a climber or a sprinter, a domestique or a general classification contender.\nCarbohydrates - usually in the form of rice or pasta - serve as the petrol, necessitating painfully high consumption levels.\nProteins - predominantly fish or chicken - are always unprocessed and fibre is kept low to minimise gut irritation and aid digestion, with fruit and vegetables often consumed in juice form.\nVegetarians tend to supplement themselves with protein shakes, in addition to plant-based proteins like tofu and seitan.\nRiders might be allowed more vegetables and fibrous foods before flatter race days, when the body will be better equipped to break them down, while red meats are saved as a treat the evening before rest days.\nOn-bike fuelling comes courtesy of roadside soigneurs who load up musette bags with a variety of high-carbohydrate forms that can be selected or discarded based on personal preference.\nEnergy bars, gels, drinks and gummies provide quick hits on tough days, while more traditional food sources include wet rice cakes, brioches, jam sandwiches, flapjacks, sweet breads and cakes for easier days.\nThe required quantities are unenviably vast. Each rider consumes close to 1.5kg of rice or pasta every day and in the region of 120g of carbohydrates per hour when on the bike - the equivalent carbohydrate content of five hourly bananas. \nOne EF rider once went through four tubs of maple syrup during the three-week race.\nTeam backroom staff hand out grab bags of high-energy foods to their riders to enable them to fuel mid-stage\nBlandy's laptop contains a treasure trove of nutritional information to enable his menu design.\nOne spreadsheet allows him to compare every food item's nutrient values to decide whether to cook with aubergines or parsnips, quinoa or couscous, chicken breast or chicken thigh.\nAnother document comprises the EF Education-EasyPost recipe bible, listing a myriad of soups, salads, carbohydrates, proteins, sides, desserts, post-race snacks and drinks. In a bid to combat flavour fatigue, repetition is kept to an absolute minimum across a three-week race.\n\"The food I make is all transparent,\" says Blandy. \"There are no rich sauces, it's all plain, simple cooking with a light amount of seasoning, light amount of oil, fresh herbs and citrus.\n\"Instead of putting flavour in with cream, salt and butter we're adding it with herbs and citrus because they are low calorie and contain antioxidants.\"\nIt does not lend itself to the type of innovative kitchen artistry you might see on television shows or in fancy restaurants.\n\"When I'm teaching new chefs, I always say the only way they will mess it up is by being too 'cheffy,'\" says Blandy.\n\"You need to swallow your chef ego and put it into a dessert or play around at the end of a race. Go wild then but don't mess with the simple stuff: the carbohydrates and proteins. Give the guys what they want and they will be happy.\n\"I've cooked risottos before and they've just asked for plain basmati rice. They aren't there on a holiday. They don't care about fancy food. They are literally there to fuel.\"\nRider nutrition has evolved since Joaquim Galera was considering the day's menu at the 1964 Tour de France\nBlandy estimates he has stayed - and therefore been tasked with cooking - at more than 300 hotels during his time working for EF Education-EasyPost. The transient nature of the job presents numerous logistical headaches.\nA chef's day at the Tour de France begins around 06:00. They must prepare fresh breakfast items (all packaged food has already been set up the night before) for 08:00 before packing up and driving to the next hotel while the race is ongoing.\nAs well as cooking the food, they are also responsible for procuring it - a task that varies depending on team and, crucially, sponsor.\nBlandy's experience of European supermarkets means he knows where to find the highest-quality food and shops personally for most of it, in addition to emailing hotels in advance to order some perishable items.\nConversely, Visma-Lease a Bike have been sponsored since 2014 by Dutch supermarket Jumbo, who provide all their food at every race, including the Tour de France.\n\"During a Grand Tour there are three times that a new delivery comes from the Netherlands to stock up on fresh produce,\" says Redegeld. \"It's always the same Dutch food and the guys like that because they know what to expect and we know what products they like, so we can always have that available.\n\"It makes things a lot easier for the chefs who don't have to search in local supermarkets for things. For me as a nutritionist, we know the nutritional values of all the products so it makes the calculations a lot easier.\"\nUpon arriving at a hotel, chefs will begin preparations for dinner and the following day's breakfast and snacks.\nProfessional cycling teams tend to adhere to one of two dining styles.\nMost travel with customised kitchen trucks - a similar size to supermarket delivery vans - where food is stored and meals cooked. Food is then served up for the riders and wider team members in a private room inside the hotel.\nA select few teams - including Ineos Grenadiers - instead choose to travel with a far bigger lorry, which contains a kitchen and dining room.\nCamaraderie between chefs on rival teams is high. \"Sometimes you're in a hotel with six teams, so the car parks are rammed,\" says Blandy.\n\"It's manic. Everyone is sharing water and electricity. So you have to scratch each other's backs. Chefs come to me and ask for an ingredient and I go to them. We help each other out.\"\nBlandy cooks in the car park, before serving up in a dining room in the team hotel\nIt is a world away from the three successive weeks of pasta with tomato sauce that riders just a generation ago were accustomed to stomaching throughout their Tour de France endeavours.\nRedegeld predicts the nutrition evolution will continue, suggesting that within a decade or so teams will employ DNA analysis to take rider fuelling personalisation to the next level.\nBut all the analytics are worthless without someone to prepare the food.\nEarlier this year, Blandy was all set for a quiet week at home when he received an SOS from the team.\nHe was given half an hour to pack his bags and jump in a taxi to the airport because a fellow EF Education-EasyPost chef had fallen ill before the Paris-Roubaix race.\n\"I rolled my knives up and threw them in a suitcase,\" he says. \"I felt like chef special forces.\"\nCooking is serious business in the elite cycling world.\nPanenka - the penalty that killed a career and started a feud\nThe people v Andy Murray: Four weeks that changed him and us\nRunning on a volcano's rim - the race in the shadow of an eruption\nThe awkward questions behind Hungary's football revival\nFleeing Kabul, chasing gold - the story of a refugee Olympian"

        "content": "Panenka - the penalty that killed a career and started a feud\nIn the end, the Germans' eagerness to go on holiday changed history.\nTheir Euro 1976 final against Czechoslovakia was never meant to go to penalties.\nWest Germany - defending European champions, reigning World Cup winners - were heavy favourites.\nEven if Czechoslovakia held out through extra time, the initial plan had been for a replay two days later. Welsh referee Clive Thomas had been told to delay his return home from host nation Yugoslavia to cover the eventuality.\nA few hours before the match though, the plan changed.\n\"It was a request from the German Football Association,\" remembers Antonin Panenka.\n\"They said that their players had already booked some holidays, blah, blah, blah, and asked if penalties could be taken straight away instead of a replay.\"\nCzechoslovakia figured, as underdogs, they were more likely to prevail in a shoot-out than a second match, so they agreed.\nPanenka, an elegant, passing playmaker, mentally checked his plan once more.\nAll was in order. No alteration necessary, no doubt admitted.\nA ploy two years in the making that would make him famous and infamous, a hero and an enemy - whether it succeeded or not - was ready.\nAntonin Panenka played 59 times for Czechoslovakia, scoring 17 goals, and was named as part of Uefa's Team of the Tournament at Euro 1976\nBack home, Panenka had been involved in another, almost daily, penalty contest.\nAfter training at his Prague club side Bohemians, Panenka and goalkeeper Zdenek Hruska would stay behind to practise spot-kicks.\nIt was a very personal duel. Panenka would have five penalties - he would have to score all five, Hruska would have to save just one. Whoever lost would buy their post-training beer or chocolate.\n\"I was constantly paying him,\" says Panenka.\n\"So in the evenings I would think up ways to beat him - that's when I realised that as I ran up the goalkeeper would wait for the last second and then gamble, diving to the left or the right.\n\"I thought: 'What if I send the ball almost directly into the centre of the goal?'\"\nPanenka tried it. He found that introducing another possible penalty and some hesitation to Hruska's mind meant he was winning more, spending less and still getting his post-training treat.\nIt could have stopped there and remained a piece of unseen showboating. But Panenka realised his new technique was more than that. He had unearthed a legitimate 12-yard tactic.\nOver the next couple of years, he tested it on larger and larger stages. First, in training, then in friendlies and finally, the month before Euro 1976, against local rivals Dukla Prague in a competitive fixture.\nEach time it worked and his conviction grew.\n\"I made no secret of it,\" Panenka says.\n\"Here [in Czechoslovakia] people were well aware of it.\n\"But in western countries, in top football countries nobody was interested in Czechoslovak football at all.\n\"Maybe they were kept up with some results, but they didn't watch our games.\"\nSo, there was no laminated cheat sheet or whispered instructions from a backroom analyst for Sepp Maier.\nAs the West German goalkeeper crouched on his goalline and fixed his eyes on Panenka, he had only his own instincts to go on.\nMaier's team-mate Uli Hoeness had blazed the previous spot-kick over the bar. It was the first miss of the shoot-out, after extra time finished with the teams still locked together at 2-2.\nInstantly the stakes became sudden death and sky high. If Panenka scored, West Germany were beaten.\nPanenka's run-up was long and fast. He seemed intent, like Hoeness, on thumping his instep through the back of the ball.\nInstead, with the most important kick of his life, he fell back on his trusted trick. A deft tickle sent the ball floating down the centre of the goal. Panenka's arm was aloft in celebration before it hit the net. Maier, flummoxed and failing, scrambled back to his feet, but only in time to shoot a rueful look at Panenka wheeling away in celebration.\nPanenka's clipped penalty secured a 5-3 shoot-out win after a 2-2 draw following extra time\n\"None of us could believe we were European champions,\" said Panenka. \"It was like Alice in Wonderland.\"\nIt was just as surreal back in Prague. Their European Championship win came eight years after the Prague Spring - when a Soviet-led herd of tanks had rolled across the border and crushed attempts to loosen the country's communist system.\nSince then, large public gatherings had been rare, permitted only for orchestrated welcomes of foreign dignitaries. When the team arrived with Czechoslovakia though, there was no holding back the emotion or the numbers.\n\"Nobody expected that so many people would come to give us such a warm welcome,\" Panenka remembers.\n\"When some head of state came, the roads used to be lined with young people holding parade wands.\n\"But it was all sort of forced. This time though they all came spontaneously to greet us and show their appreciation. I had never experienced anything like that before. It was one of the best moments of my football career.\"\nPanenka's decisive, distinctive penalty made him centre of attention. Not just for the crowd, but for the authorities as well.\nCzechoslovakians had been subjected to a process dubbed 'normalisation' since their attempt to diverge from the Soviet model. The remoulding or removing of dissident elements had gone far beyond politics.\nJust three months before Euro 1976, Czechoslovakia's secret police had arrested a psychedelic rock band and other underground musicians, fearful that long hair and counter-cultural lyrics alone could fuel revolution.\nIt is estimated that more than 4,500 tanks, led by the Soviet Union and support by Eastern Bloc nations Bulgaria, Poland and Hungary, entered Czechoslovakia in 1968\nPanenka's penalty - hit with a disregard for convention and casual panache - was definitely not \"normal\".\nTo repeat his trick on a stage of such scale carried significant personal, as well as sporting, risk.\n\"I would never have thought that politics and sport or politics and football could be linked like this, but it's true that there were some looking at it in this way,\" says Panenka.\n\"When it was discussed in political circles, they could take it as my contempt for the political system.\n\"If I hadn't converted the penalty, it probably would have had some consequences for me, some sanction or another problem.\"\nThat Panenka found the net spared him uncomfortable questions and a possible new career in a factory or mine.\nBut by scoring he made another enemy.\nDefeat was an unusual sensation for Maier, part of a Bayern side that had won its third straight European Cup the previous month. Humiliation was unheard of.\nThe Scotsman's report from Belgrade described how Panenka's one kick blew apart two preconceptions: Czechoslovakia's faceless, collective style and West Germany, and Maier's, inevitable competence, control and victory.\n\"Czechoslovakia's old, hard discipline is still evident,\" wrote Ian Wood.\n\"But the cult of the personality has gained more than a fragile toe-hold and nowhere was the new zest more perfectly illustrated than when Panenka gave the Czechs the championship by grounding the hapless Sepp Maier with a dummy of supreme impudence.\"\nElsewhere there were harsher descriptions than \"hapless\".\n\"Some foreign journalists, especially the ones from the West, insisted that I made fun of Maier, that I made him a clown and things like that,\" says Panenka.\n\"It was not true. For me, it was just the easiest way to score a goal. But Maier believed what those journalists wrote about me having ridiculed him.\n\"Whenever he heard the name 'Panenka', it was terribly unpleasant for him and he would react very irritably.\n\"He didn't speak to me for the next 35 years.\"\nPanenka and Maier have been reunited at several charity and commemorative events since the Euro 1976 final\nBut as the decades passed, there has been a thaw.\nSince the original, the 'Panenka' has been repeated and proven as a bona-fide - if high-risk - tactic by some of the biggest names on the most momentous occasions.\nZinedine Zidane scored one in the 2006 World Cup final against Italy. Memorably for England fans, Andrea Pirlo clipped one past Joe Hart in a Euro 2012 shoot-out. Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Thierry Henry, Neymar and Zlatan Ibrahimovic have all pulled it off.\nMaier is no longer a lonely fall guy. Plenty of goalkeepers have been similarly beaten. The sting of 1976 has been drawn, the stigma is gone. Mostly.\nMaier declined a request to be interviewed for this article.\n\"I think that our relationship has been perfectly normal lately,\" says Panenka.\n\"The last time I met him was four or five years ago. There was some press conference arranged by the German side here in Prague, and I could see that he wasn't annoyed or angry with me. We had a beer and played golf together.\n\"He could even smile about the penalty kick. When he first saw me on that most recent trip, he wagged his finger at me and gestured the trajectory of a chipped ball with his hand.\"\nEven Panenka's own relationship with his 1976 penalty is complex.\nHis fizzing set-pieces, his dead-eyed shooting, his scalpel-sharp passing goes uncredited, buried under the fame of his own creation.\n\"I am a bit down the middle about it,\" he says fittingly and finally about the 1976 penalty.\n\"On the one hand I am proud that the penalty was invented, that it is so famous and that it is repeated by the best players. But it's true that whenever the name Panenka is mentioned, everybody just thinks about 'the Panenka penalty'.\n\"So on the one hand I am proud, but on the other hand I am a bit unhappy that the penalty erased everything I wanted to give the viewers - a lot of passes, goals, chances I created.\n\"In a sense, the penalty killed my career.\"\nIf he had that moment again, staring down Maier, the European Championship on the line, would he dare to do the same again? Or would he play it straight with a shot that wouldn't define him forever for so many?\nPanenka's answer is emphatic.\n\"Of course, I would do the same! Sure! I can't do anything else.\"\nMadrid, Mbappe and a mission of a lifetime\n'I was lost' - Dancing with fans, hiding the pain"

        "content": "The people v Andy Murray: Four weeks that changed him and us\nInscribed above the doors that lead to Wimbledon's Centre Court is a famous line from Rudyard Kipling's poem, If.\n\"If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster and treat those two impostors just the same,\" it reads.\nIt is there to remind the world's best and their challengers that you are defined by more than the scoreboard.\nNo-one knows that as well as Andy Murray.\nThe grass courts at SW19 were the scene of a four-week period in 2012 that changed the way a swathe of the British public thought of Murray. Beaten in the Wimbledon final, he regrouped, returned and won Olympic gold on the same court in front of packed stands. \nHe swore. He cried. He celebrated. He felt the love.\nThis is the story of the 28 days that confirmed Murray as a national treasure.\nMurray watched Jessica Ennis-Hill, Mo Farah and Greg Rutherford win athletics golds the night before his London 2012 final against Roger Federer\nBefore he was Sir Andrew Murray OBE, world number one, three-time Grand Slam champion, one of the nation's greatest-ever athletes... he was, to one woman at least, something altogether less celebratory.\nIn 2006, the football World Cup was taking place at the same time as Wimbledon. A 19-year-old Murray, himself once a promising youth footballer, joked in an interview that he would support \"whoever England were playing against\".\nIt went down like a lead balloon. He was abused in the comments of a blog he wrote on his website and even his wristbands, decorated with the Scottish saltire, attracted scrutiny. \nMurray had become a lightning rod, attracting ire in an edgy Anglo-Scottish atmosphere. The previous month, the then Scottish First Minister had been criticised for saying he would not be supporting England.\nBut the reaction to Murray's joke was on a far larger scale.\nIn the aftermath, Murray, playing only his second Wimbledon, walked past a spectator on the way to his match. He overheard her telling a friend, in expletive-laden and anti-Scottish language, that she had just spotted him.\n\"I was like, What? I was 19. This is my home tournament. Why is this happening?\" Murray remembered in a 2017 interview., external\n\"I was still a kid and I was getting things sent to my locker saying things like: 'I hope you lose every tennis match for the rest of your life.'\"\nBy the time 2012 rolled around, Murray had already broken new ground. \nHe had reached the US Open final in 2008, becoming the first British man to make a major final since Greg Rusedski in New York 11 years earlier. \nTwo further Slam final appearances followed - the Australian Open in 2010 and 2011 - but Britain was still searching for a first male major singles champion since Fred Perry in 1936.\nBut the ambivalence of some of the general public remained. \nAs the Twitter joke went, Murray was British when he won and Scottish when he lost. \nIt sometimes seemed there was something inordinate about Murray - his outspokenness was loved to a certain point, his on-court anger amusing when he was winning but derided when he was losing. \nAt this point, Murray was a nascent member of the Big Four. Roger Federer was transcendent, described as a 'god', especially at Wimbledon. Rafael Nadal had the grit, the determination, the never-say-die attitude. \nNovak Djokovic, another relative newcomer trying to upset their duopoly, defied belief, limbs bending every which way, equipped with an endurance level and mental strength few can match.\nBut Murray? Murray was the most human. A man who sometimes looked as if he actively hated the sport of tennis. No-one could ever accuse Murray of hiding his emotions. And that rubbed up some the wrong way.\nHe was accused of being whingey, of being anti-English, of being boring, when really he was doing what we all do - getting frustrated about the job and attempting to have a laugh along with it.\n\"I think it's very difficult for any young player who is thrust into the spotlight to get to grips or feel comfortable with facing and understanding the media,\" said his mum Judy, speaking on Andy Murray: Will to Win, a recent BBC Sport documentary.\n\"One of the things in tennis is that players have to face the media after every match whether they win or lose. Of course, it's a lot easier to face the media when you're winning.\n\"As an 18-year-old he'd had a little bit of media training but nothing really prepares you for suddenly being in front of a room of about 300 people. \n\"I think his reaction to anything is to be truthful and say what you're thinking. In years to come, you will become much more practised.\"\nMurray, seen here aged 13 at a high-profile junior tournament in Tarbes, has long been accustomed to the attention, hype and scrutiny of elite tennis life\nAnd so to Wimbledon. The crowds gathered on Henman Hill - in the days when shouts of \"come on, Tim!\" still raised a chuckle on Centre Court - to watch the human take on the god.\nIt was Murray's first Wimbledon final, Federer's eighth. The newspapers declared Murray a hero, talking about his date with destiny. But as one paper asked on their front page: \"Can he finish the job?\"\nJohn McEnroe, commentating on BBC TV, pointed out the quandary for the crowd. \"I'm interested to see what will happen if and when, as we expect, the crowd gets behind Murray. He should be reminding them that I have no Wimbledon wins and Federer has six - but everyone loves Roger.\"\nThe tennis was electric. Murray was excellent. Federer was better. But it was the speech that followed, made as Murray walked up to accept the runner-up trophy, that lingers in people's minds.\nMurray puffed out his cheeks as he tried to speak, before he was drowned out by the noise from the crowd. He smiled, shook his head and exhaled before, with a voice on the verge of breaking, saying: \"I'm going to try this. And it isn't going to be easy...\"\nEven now, it's hard to watch. His voice cracked throughout. There's the dry humour - Federer \"is not bad for a 30-year-old\" - and the heartfelt thanks to his team. The acknowledgement that \"I'm getting closer\", both honest and cruel to think about. But it's the bit where he thanks the crowd, the raw emotion, that really cuts through. \nHe was held up by three separate ovations before departing to another. By the end, his mother, wife-to-be and plenty of those in the stands were in tears. \n\"I felt like I was playing for the nation,\" Murray said later. \"And I couldn't quite do it.”\nIt was pure emotion. The man who had been accused of being cold, grumpy, anti-English, was standing at Wimbledon - that most quintessentially English of places - in tears, telling the crowd how much their support means to him.\n\"To watch him communicate how much that moment meant to him made me want to root for him more, no question,\" Henman said in a BBC retrospective in 2020.\n\"I find it slightly sad that it took him to cry in his acceptance speech for people to suddenly take a step back and go: 'Wow, he has got a heart. He is a sensitive soul.'\"\nThis video can not be played\nWimbledon 2012: Andy Murray's tears in defeat\nThe defeat certainly cut deep.\n\"I was unbelievably upset, disappointed and all of those things,\" says Murray looking back at that defeat by Federer.\n\"I said to myself after that I may never win a Grand Slam. I was working as hard as I could work and getting close, but it was never quite enough.\n\"But the Olympics was coming up and I had to make the most of it. I got back on the practice court and ended up having probably the most important week of my tennis career.\"\nFour weeks to the day after the Wimbledon final, at the same venue, Murray was striding out behind Federer once again. \nThis time, it was the Olympics. The weather had gone from drizzly to baking hot, the roof wide open to let the sunlight flow down on to Centre Court. \nAnd, with the All England Club's all-white dress code out the window and Britain gripped by the Games, the atmosphere was bubbling.\nWATCH: Andy Murray: Will to Win\nLISTEN: Sporting Giants - Andy Murray\nMurray to retire after Paris Olympics\n'Compelling on and off court' - a decade on tour with Murray\n\"That day was the first time I really saw the crowd really behind him,\" reflects McEnroe.\nSingles gold was the one thing missing from Federer's packed CV, and given the surface and venue, he was the favourite. \nAnd yet, in just under two hours, Murray overwhelmed him in straight sets to claim what he later described as \"the biggest win of my life\". \nIn front of a rapturous crowd, Murray became the first British man to win Olympic singles gold since Josiah Ritchie in 1908.\nThe next day, Murray shared space on the back pages with Usain Bolt and Jessica Ennis-Hill. He had watched the athletics the night before his final to inspire him. He later wrote in his autobiography that \"as an individual sportsman, I have certainly never experienced anything like it\".\n\"I think that was the making of him really,\" says Jamie Murray, Andy's older brother and seven-time Grand Slam doubles champion. \nThat year was undoubtedly a turning point. Murray went on to win his first Grand Slam at the US Open two months after the Olympics, and ended the year as the world number three. But something had also shifted for the public.\nAs one fan told the Guardian, external after his Olympic triumph: \"I didn't used to like him - he was no Tim. I started liking him when he showed some emotion after losing to Federer in the Wimbledon final. You can see how much it means to him.\" \nMurray himself reflected after his US Open win that \"it's a shame that it took me crying at Wimbledon to maybe change that a little bit, but the support I've had over the last few months has been unbelievable.''\n\"In 2012, after he won the US Open, there was an opportunity to come back to Dunblane and do an open-top bus tour,\" Judy remembered.\n\"Andy is really quite shy and under the radar, he was perhaps a little unsure about that and whether anybody would turn up or be interested.\n\"But the crowds that were trying to come into the town that day... The high street in Dunblane is a one-way street, very narrow, and we got off on the dual carriageway and walked down into the high street.\n\"The turnout of the crowds, it was canny.\"\nMurray and his wife Kim have reopened a hotel in his hometown of Dunblane, partly inspired by a desire to give back to the local community\nIt is now 12 years since that summer. Murray has played in his final Wimbledon and is approaching his final Olympics. In that time, he has won three majors, become world number one, had a metal hip inserted and become a feminist icon. He is given ovations every time he walks out at Wimbledon.\nThere are still countless tweets about Murray doing it again, the rollercoaster ride he takes us on as he scraps and rages against the dying light.\nMurray is a bone-fide national treasure, and those four weeks at Wimbledon played no small part in that.\nAs three-time finalist Andy Roddick put it: \"He deserves his moment to say goodbye at Wimbledon. He's too important to Great Britain and Wimbledon history to not have it.\"\nThis feature was initially published on 27 June 2024\nFrom 15 Wimbledon campaigns, Murray has won two singles titles.

        "content": "Running on a volcano's rim - the race in the shadow of an eruption\nIts name alone captures trail-running's spirit of adventure. And it fits perfectly.\nTransvulcania is one of the world’s toughest and most spectacular ultra-marathons, skirting along a volcanic ridgeline in the Canary Islands.\nIt takes place on the island of La Palma, known as La Isla Bonita for its wealth of natural beauty.\nYet in 2021 there was a devastating reminder that Mother Nature possesses beastly power as well.\nFor the first time in 50 years, that volcanic ridge erupted.\nBefore 2021, La Palma had been spared any volcanic eruption since 1971 \nThere had been warnings. A cluster of small earthquakes started under the Cumbre Vieja ridge on 11 September.\nThen on 19 September, the eruption began a little west of the ridgeline. The first lava flows snaked down slopes.\nHomes were evacuated, livestock moved across the island and farmers raced to guard or salvage their crops.\nThere was little they could do. Houses were swamped, roads barricaded and fields buried by molten flows and layers of ash.\nTen days after the eruption had started, the lava flow completed its 6km (3.7 mile) journey across La Palma, falling, steaming, into the Atlantic Ocean.\nLa Palma’s previous eruption in 1971, from the south of the same ridge, went on for a month. The 2021 eruption lasted for 85 days.\nHaving had to cancel the 2020 race because of the coronavirus pandemic, Transvulcania's organisers were left with no choice but to scratch the 2021 event.\nIn that moment, it was the least of the island's worries.\nUltimately more than 7,000 people had to be evacuated and more than 3,000 properties were destroyed, along with farmland covering roughly 1,500 football pitches. \nThe financial damage was estimated as 862.7m euros (£729m).\nNow, though, Transvulcania has returned to help La Palma recover, along with two of Britain’s best trail-runners.\nThe lava flows damaged La Palma's agricultural industry, which is centred around bananas\nTransvulcania is a week-long festival of races over different distances, with an ultra-marathon of 73km (45 miles) with 4.3km (2.7 miles) of elevation gain as the highlight.\nIf La Palma was a nation, trail-running would be its national sport, so when Transvulcania started in 2009, it was welcomed by locals.\nTraditionally, thousands of spectators line the route; some climbing up on to the ridge to see runners scale the heights, others dragging sofas out of their houses so they can cheer the field through the streets.\nThe top runners are seen as celebrities. Fans ask them for high fives and selfies; taxi drivers excitedly chat about who had been in their cab that week.\nTheir passengers are making longer and longer journeys to get to La Palma now, with elite athletes and intrepid amateurs alike drawn from overseas for the race.\nThe course is completed by the best male runners in about seven hours and the best female runners in approximately eight\nAbout 2,350 signed up for this year's edition from 52 nations, including Britain's Jon Albon, who finished fourth in 2019.\n\"It's a spectacular place to visit and experience,\" he tells BBC Sport. \"It's like no other place I've been to, with trails like no others I've run, and the locals are really passionate.\n\"They really get into the race and it feels like this is the big happening of the year. They are really happy people who are just enjoying life and enjoying us being there and experiencing their island.\"\nWhen Transvulcania returned in 2022 in the immediate aftermath of the eruption, it was as part of the UTMB World Series. Some felt that, being run by ultra-running's highest-profile marketing empire, the race had lost part of its local connection.\nSergio Rodriguez, president of the Cabildo of La Palma, the island council, has described Transvulcania as a \"symbol of our territory\".\nWhen Transvulcania severed ties with UTMB last September, Rodriguez vowed to \"bring our race back to our people\" and \"recover its essence\".\n\"It’s a unique race that leaves an indelible mark on La Palma,\" he says. \"It's an event that goes beyond sport; it has a positive impact on the island in every way.\"\nAlbon was a multiple world champion in obstacle course racing before switching to the trails\nIn the absence of their UTMB association, Transvulcania secured sportswear giant Adidas as title sponsor, local companies returned to lend their support and some big-name entrants were announced for May's race, including Albon and Tom Evans.\nFormerly a British Army Captain, Evans came first at the prestigious 100-mile Western States race in 2023, while Albon, who now lives in Norway, won the 2019 trail-running world championships.\nThey are just two of La Palma's visitors this year. While other areas of the Canary Islands have seen tourist numbers return to or surpass pre-pandemic levels - to the irritation of some locals, external - La Palma is still to fully bounce back., external\n\"The first-order effect of us being there and racing is minimal,\" says Evans. \"But if it means more people see how beautiful the island is and we raise awareness of those who need help, then the second and third-order effects can end up making a big difference.\"\nAlbon, third from right, and Evans, second from right, in the leading group at this year's Transvulcania\nLa Palma’s clear, dark skies make it perfect for stargazing, and the Transvulcania ultra starts under spectacular constellations at 6am.\nGround-up lava rocks have created black-sand trails and beaches, and about 900 runners gather beside a lighthouse on the island's southern tip.\nWhat awaits them is a journey past volcanoes, through prehistoric pine forests and across lunar-like landscapes.\nFirst, they must make a steady climb of 17km up to almost 2,000m, from where they can watch the sun rise and look down upon the sea of clouds, blown across the Atlantic by trade winds and clinging to La Palma's mountains like a cotton wool blanket.\nImmaculately maintained trails then guide them along a volcanic ridge and crater to an observatory at the Roque de los Muchachos, the island's highest point at 2,426m.\nTransvulcania begins in a blaze of headlights and starlight\nA punishing 17km descent back to sea level on the west coast follows, before the runners track a parched riverbed to the finish in Los Llanos De Aridane.\nAlbon and Evans were among the lead group for the first three hours, before Albon edged clear to win in seven hours three minutes. Evans crossed two minutes later, hand-in-hand with Russian training partner Dmitry Mityaev, to complete the podium.\nAlbon's highlight wasn't winning, though, it was \"just being on the ridge as the sun's coming up. Turning off the head torches, running in a group, testing out how each other feels, then feeling strong and powerful and in control. That is a great feeling, and hopefully it's one I can think back to come Western.\"\nAlbon will compete in the Western States race in California this weekend, aiming to emulate his success in La Palma\nThis Saturday, Albon will try to emulate Evans’ feat of winning the Western States in California.\nEvans, meanwhile, is focusing on UTMB and improving on his third-placed finish in 2022.\nAs for Transvulcania, is seems Rodriguez has fulfilled his pledge.\n\"It felt like the Transvulcania of old,\" says Albon.\n\"Everyone was really excited to be racing, it was competitive and the organisers were super happy to be running the race how they wanted to run it.\n\"One of the great things with trail-running is that each race seems to have a bit of character and it's that you're hoping to experience as much as the course itself. It's really nice when places retain that.\"\nThe awkward questions behind Hungary's football revival\nFleeing Kabul, chasing gold - the story of a refugee Olympian\nMadrid, Mbappe and a mission of a lifetime\n'I was lost' - Dancing with fans, hiding the pain\nFights, bikes & late nights - six images of a Manchester rivalry"

Now she is chasing her third Olympic gold medal.\nJade Jones, 31, Taekwondo\nEvent: Women's -57kg\nWhen: 8 August\nHighs of winning back-to-back golds at London 2012 and Rio 2016 were followed by the low of a shock first-round defeat in Tokyo.\nThere was a chance Jones might not be allowed to compete in Paris. She avoided a ban after a doping violation and bids to become the first fighter to win three taekwondo gold medals.\nAndy Murray is the only tennis player to win two Olympic singles gold medals\nAndy Murray, 37, Tennis\nEvent: Men's doubles\nWhen: Starts 27 July\nAmong everything he has achieved, and everything he has seen, Murray ranks the Olympics as one of the most special experiences of his enviable career.\nFittingly, the London 2012 and Rio 2016 gold medallist is signing off in Paris before retiring from playing professionally.\nAdam Peaty, 29, Swimming\nEvent: Men's 100m breaststroke\nWhen: 27 July (heats), 28 July (final)\nThere was a time when Peaty seemed invincible. Clocking the top 20 times of all-time ensured he dominated his event for nearly a decade.\nInjuries and personal issues led to a loss of form and a revaluation of what was important. Having come through a \"self-destructive spiral\", Peaty will challenge for a third successive gold medal.\nMax Whitlock, 31, Gymnastics\nEvent: Men's pommel horse\nWhen: 3 August\nAnother iconic British Olympian in one final hurrah before retirement.

But the medal which matters most continues to be evasive. \nWinning a second world title last year bodes well going into her fourth shot at standing on the Olympic podium.\nKeely Hodgkinson, 22, Athletics\nEvent: Women's 800m\nWhen: 2-5 August\nAn Olympic underdog three years ago, Hodgkinson has evolved into a gold medal favourite in Paris.\nBreaking Kelly Holmes' 26-year British record clinched silver in Tokyo and even illness could not stop her winning the European title last month. \nSetting a new national record at the Diamond League meet in London at the weekend further underlined her credentials.\nTom Pidcock, 24, Cycling\nEvents: Mountain Bike, Road Race\nWhen: 29 July, (mountain bike), 3 August (road)\nWhether haring down a treacherous Tour de France descent, or bunny hopping up sandy terrain, multi-eventer Pidcock is filling the void left by Britain's millennial cycling superstars.\nPidcock defends the mountain bike gold he won in Tokyo before switching to the road, where success would make amends for missing this month's Tour after contracting Covid.\nListen: Watch out Paris - Campbell\nMolly Caudery, 24, Athletics\nEvent: Women's Pole Vault\nWhen: 5-7 August\nA sign of how impressive 2024 has been is the huge shift of expectation for Caudery. \nIn January, she simply wanted to make the Olympics team.

        "content": "The famous Olympic rings adorn the iconic Eiffel Tower in Paris for the Games\nThe Paris 2024 Olympic Games will showcase 3,800 hours of live sport and award 329 gold medals in 32 sports over 18 days of competition across the capital and in other parts of France.\nHere is all you need to know about the 34th summer Olympics. \n\nThe opening ceremony to signal the official start of the Paris 2024 Olympics will be held on Friday, 26 July.\nBut the sporting action actually begins on Wednesday, 24 July with pool matches in football, rugby sevens, handball and archery. \nThe ambitious opening ceremony will take place along the River Seine instead of in a stadium.\nThe first medals will be awarded a day later and competition will conclude on 11 August, with the closing ceremony later that evening.\nThe women's 100m final will be held at 20:20 BST on Saturday, 3 August, and a little over 24 hours later, at 20:50 BST on 4 August, it will be the men's 100m final. Both will take place at the Stade de France, where all the track and field events are being held.  \nParis 2024 day-by-day guide\nFull Paris 2024 schedule\nThere are 329 gold medal events at Paris 2024 with a whopping 39 medals being won on the penultimate day of competition, Saturday, 10 August.\nThe first medal of the Games will be in shooting - mixed team air rifle - and that is expected to be won at 10:30 BST on Saturday, 27 July.\nThe final medal will be awarded in women's basketball at 16:30 BST on Sunday, 11 August.\nThe only new sport for the 2024 Olympics is breaking. It is a style of dance that originated in the Bronx in New York during the 1970s but has evolved to become a competitive sport.\nIn Paris, breaking will not be seen until the latter part of the Games, with the women's event taking place on 9 August and the men's on 10 August. A total of 32 entrants, 16 men and 16 women will compete for the medals.\nBaseball/softball and karate both featured in Tokyo three years ago but have been dropped for these Olympics.\nOther tweaks to sports include a change in format for sport climbing. In Tokyo, there was only one medal on offer for both the men and women but in Paris there will be a combined medal for lead and bouldering and a separate medal event for speed climbing.\nKayak cross will also make its debut. It is a form of canoe slalom but four athletes in each heat race against each other, not just the clock.\nIn sailing two kite events have been added to the programme, windsurfer – iQFoil and kiteboarding.\nAnd in artistic swimming, men are included for the first time in Olympic history and there will also be a team acrobatic routine round making its debut.\nBreaking - the new Olympic sport explained \nWelcome to kayak cross - the chaotic new Olympic event\nTeam GB have finalised their squad for the Games with 327 athletes set to take part, external across 24 different sports. \nThey won 64 medals in Tokyo and data experts Nielsen Gracenote currently predict a total of 62 in Paris.\nGB sets Olympic & Paralympic targets for Paris 2024\nGreat Britain's team for 2024 Paris Olympics\nMeet Olympic Phryge.\nThe name is based on the traditional small Phrygian hats the Olympic and Paralympic mascots are shaped after.\nIt is a symbol of freedom through French history and represents allegorical figures of the French republic.\nThe motto of the mascots is \"Alone we go faster, but together we go further.\"\nPhryge, the Olympic mascot\nWorld Athletics has announced it will become the first international federation to award prize money at the Olympic Games.\nThe global governing body said a total prize pot of $2.4m (£1.9m) has been made available for this summer's Olympics in Paris, with gold medallists receiving $50,000 (£39,400).\nWorld Athletics to award prize money at Olympics\nRussian and Belarusian athletes will be allowed to compete as neutral athletes, known as AIN (Individual Neutral Athletes).\nThey will not take part in the opening ceremony at the 2024 Olympics in Paris, says the International Olympic Committee.\nRussia & Belarus athletes not part of Olympics opening ceremony\nThe Paris Olympics will be live across BBC TV, radio and online.\nParis is one hour ahead of the UK and the majority of the action will take place from 08:00 BST to 23:00 BST each day, although some events such as the marathons, race walks and triathlons are starting slightly earlier.\nYou can watch all the big moments live on two BBC channels as well as on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.\nBBC Radio 5 Live and Sports Extra will also bring you live commentary every day, and there will be live text, video clips and highlights on the BBC Sport website and app and across our social channels.\nHow to follow Paris 2024 Olympics across the BBC\nEvents are subject to change.

        "content": "This video can not be played\nCharlotte Dujardin: Video shows Olympian whipping horse during training\nWith the Paris 2024 Olympics just days away, the equestrian world has been rocked by the news of Charlotte Dujardin's withdrawal, and subsequent provisional suspension, after footage emerged of her \"excessively\" whipping a horse.\nThe video, since obtained by the BBC, shows Dujardin repeatedly striking the horse with a long whip around its legs.\nHere, BBC Sport recaps what happened, the reaction, and looks at what happens next.\nDujardin, 39, made her name at the London 2012 Olympics, when she won individual and team dressage gold on Valegro.\nFour years later, they won individual gold and team silver, before Dujardin sealed double bronze on Gio at the Tokyo Games in 2021.\nDujardin is also a two-time world and multiple European champion, and is widely seen as the darling of British dressage.\nHistory beckoned at the upcoming Paris Olympics, where a medal of any colour would have seen her become Britain's outright most decorated female Olympian - a title she currently shares with former cyclist Dame Laura Kenny.\nShe was set to compete on Imhotep, known as Pete - her first horse since Valegro to score more than 90% in international competition. The pair have been unbeaten since last year's European Championships.\nOn Tuesday, Dujardin released a statement saying she was withdrawing from the Paris Olympics after a video emerged showing her \"making an error of judgement\".\nShe was later provisionally suspended by equestrian's governing body the FEI.\nThe FEI said it had received footage showing Dujardin \"engaging in conduct contrary to the principles of horse welfare - during a training session conducted at Ms Dujardin's private stable\".\nThe FEI said Dujardin confirmed she was the individual in the video which was \"filmed several years ago\" and \"requested to be provisionally suspended pending the outcome of the investigations\".\nBoth the British Equestrian (BEF) and British Dressage (BD) have also imposed a provisional suspension on Dujardin pending the outcome of the FEI investigation.\nDujardin said: \"What happened was completely out of character and does not reflect how I train my horses or coach my pupils, however there is no excuse.\n\"I am deeply ashamed and should have set a better example in that moment.\"\nDujardin whistleblower wants to 'save dressage'\nGB's Dujardin given provisional ban and out of Games\nDujardin out of Olympics after 'error of judgement'\nOn Wednesday Dujardin had her UK Sport funding suspended pending the outcome of the FEI investigation, while she has also been dropped as an ambassador for horse welfare charity Brooke.\nTwo of her sponsors, equestrian insurance company KBIS and Danish equestrian equipment company Equine LTS, have terminated their deals with her.\nWorld Horse Welfare chief executive Roly Owers said the Dujardin case is a \"massive wake-up call for anyone who thinks this is not important\".\nHe added: \"This story is another salutary reminder of how vital it is that equestrians put the welfare of the horse first, all of the time, whether in the competition arena or behind closed doors.\n\"Respect for the horse must be at the heart of every equestrian, and every equestrian sport, and their actions must demonstrate that respect all of the time.\n\"World Horse Welfare actively supports horse sport, but there cannot be any tolerance for unacceptable practices, no matter how experienced the rider or coach.\"\nClaire Bass, the UK's senior campaigns director for Humane Society International, told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"It is not a case of one bad apple or necessarily Charlotte's behaviour being egregious. With the whole industry the cart is rotten.\n\"Exposes like this lifts the lid behind the curtain on the cruelty that is inherent in these types of sports.\n\"If people want to get a medal for dancing then they should take part in the new breakdancing event at the Olympics.\"\nHowever, top dressage instructor Pammy Hutton told BBC Sport she hoped it was \"out-of-character\" for Dujardin, having never seen her use a whip in that way before.\nCharlotte Dujardin has won six Olympic medals - three gold, one silver and two bronze\nUnlike in horse racing, where they can be used on a limited number of occasions, whips are banned in international dressage competition. However, they can be used in practice areas.\nUnder British Equestrian's code of conduct, a whip must not be misused or used excessively, while it also says the \"abuse of a horse using natural riding aids or artificial aids (e.g. whips, spurs, etc.) will not be tolerated\".\nThe type of whip used by Dujardin in the video is a schooling whip, which is used to encourage or correct the horse in training.\nEquestrian writer Madeleine Hill told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: \"Generally you can't use the whip too harshly because horses are very sensitive and they will react badly.\n\"In dressage I would say it is used as a training aid and quite cautiously.\"\nHutton said: \"A horse will move a fly off its backside by swishing its tail, it will react to the lightest of touches.\"\nEarlier this month Danish TV station TV2 reported that Denmark's reserve rider Carina Cassoe Kruth had been replaced, external in the Paris squad on the eve of the team announcement after a controversial training video was sent to the Danish Riding Association.\nKruth told TV2 she \"deeply regretted\" her \"clear error\". It came just months after Andreas Helgstrand was banned from the Danish team until 2025 after an undercover documentary exposed the use of what the Danish Riding Association said were \"unacceptable\" training methods at Helgstrand Dressage training stables.\nThe undercover journalist found horses with welts from whips, mouth sores and spur marks that were hidden with shoe polish. They were also filmed being ridden in rollkur (hyperflexion of the neck). Helgstrand Dressage said the mistreatment \"did not live up to our guidelines and values\".\nEarlier this year, former Colombia and then United States rider Cesar Parra was suspended by the FEI pending an investigation into \"the disturbing and abhorrent images and videos\" that emerged of his training techniques.\nThree years ago at the Tokyo Olympics, a German coach was thrown out of the Games for punching a horse who was refusing to jump during the modern pentathlon.\nAs a result, showjumping is to be removed from the sport - a change that will come into effect after the Paris Olympics. It will be replaced by an obstacle course, but the decision has been widely criticised by athletes.\nAt the same Games, a Swiss horse in the eventing was euthanised after being injured in the cross-country, while an Irish horse was able to continue competing in the showjumping despite bleeding from its nostrils.\nDujardin was named alongside Carl Hester (on Fame) and world champion Lottie Fry (Glamourdale) in the dressage squad, with Becky Moody the travelling reserve.\nMoody (on Jagerbomb) will now compete while Andrew Gould (Indigro) has been called up as the alternate.\nThe dressage events get under way on 30 July at Chateau de Versailles, concluding the following day.\nAnimal rights charity Peta has called for the removal of equestrian events from the Olympic programme.\nEquestrian journalist Eleanor Kelly told BBC Radio 5 Live the Dujardin incident was \"hugely damaging for equestrian as a sport\".\nShe added: \"If we lose equestrian in the Olympics, it would have an enormous effect on the whole community.\"\nThe timing of the release of the video has also been questioned.\nEquestrian writer Hill said it felt like \"sabotage\" and believes the FEI should have waited until after the Olympics before imposing any sanctions.\nShe added that \"top riders are being persecuted\" on social media by people who are against the use of horses in sport."
